Change file for package psych

to do:
modify Rd for pairs.panels to cross link to pairs2
add some features from pairs2 (group coloring, x, y option)


Version 1.0.78   July 29, 2009
Corrected bug to ICLUST introduced in version 74
added a fix to factor.stats so that it can handle seriously deficient matrices.
added a fix to principal to check case when sum of loadings is exactly 0 and thus the sign of the sum is not defined. (problem reported by Mark Leeds)

Version 1.0.77   July 25, 2009
Corrected the estimation of communalities  and eigen values in print.psych.fa  for the case of oblique rotations.  (The problem with communalities was reported by Tamaki Hattori).
Corrected a bug in error.bars reported by Junqian Gordon Xu.  (Was drawing multiple bars in case of missing data.)

Fixed a problem with weird multiple R in Omega

Version 1.0.76    July 4, 2009
fixed incorrect p value for negative correlations in r.test
Yet another check for polycor to get through the Mac test on CRAN.

Version 1.0.75  July 1, 2009
Report (once again) communalities and uniquenesses for principal components and factors (reported missing by Ista Zahn).
Added two more data sets for examples for factor analysis   -- data(Harman).
Added yet another check to see if polycor is available. The Mac version keeps failing because polycor is NOT available for the test suite. 
Although those functions that require polycor fail gracefully if it is not there, the examples do not.

Version 1.0.74  June 25, 2009
Revised ICLUST to find weighted beta.  This is a better estimated of the general factor.  (and introduced a bug that was detected and fixed in version 78) 

Modified the examples for ICLUST to show how to get graphics output with using Rgraphviz.
Added fm="ml" option to the fa (factor analysis) function to do maximum likelihood factoring


Version 1.0.73  June 8, 2009
Added General Least Squares (gls) to fitting in fa

Revised psych_overview vignette.

Added mat.sort to sort correlation matrices to make pretty pictures.

Starting to revise the estimate for factor indeterminancy to take into account the other factors.  This is clearly exploratory at this point and is not yet part of the package.

Added a check in psych.demo() to check if the polycor package is available.  This gets around a problem in the Mac version at CRAN (I hope.)

Fixed a bug in fa(fm="wls") for 1 factor problems (reported by Ben Schalet)

Version 1.0.72 June 1, 2009
Fixed a bug introduced earlier today when printing unsorted omega general factor loadings.
Added factor adequacy measures to omega

Version 1.0.71  June 1, 2009
Reports omega for 1  factor problem
Revised print.psych to be a number of subroutines for easier maintenance.
Added function fa to combine factor.pa, factor.wls, factor.minres into one function.
Added rotation more rotation options to fa.
Fixed bug in print.psych.omega so that item numbers are correctly identified when sorting.

Version 1.0.70 May 25, 2009
Added factor.stats function to clarify the various statistics for factor analysis using the factor.pa, factor.minres, and principal functions.
Added "cluster" as a rotation option in target.rot. 
Added omega_infinity to the omega function
adjustment to sim.hierarchical to make consistent with Jensen and Weng
corrected bug in principal for case of singular matrices (reported by Gudmundur Arnkelsson) 
corrected bug in print.psych so that it now correctly sorts by loadings if desired

Version 1.0.69 April 25
Modified cosinor to allow for regression as well as optimization approaches

Version 1.0.68  April 15, 2009
Added factor.minres (basically just factor.pa with a new method) to do minimum residual exploratory factor analysis. 
Added the Holzinger.9 nine cognitive variable data set from the LISREL examples.
Added the msq (motivational state questionnaire) data set of 74 mood items and 3800 subjects.

Added sim.anova to simulate ANOVA and lm experimental designs.

Added target.rot to do targeted factor transformations (basically a Procrustian transformation) to an arbitrary target matrix.


Version 1.0.67  March 24, 2009
Have included vignettes in the package
Rewrote mat.regress to allow for raw data/covariances as input
Seriously simplified the mat.regress code

Added reliability G6+ to alpha, score.items, cluster.Cor
Changed the correction for item overlap to use smc and G6+ theory

Added corr.test to give correlations, sample sizes, and probability values for data.frames and matrix input.

Added bar graph output to the error.bars function.  (Although these "dynamite plots" should be discouraged.)

Revised count.pairwise to be much cleaner code. (Replaced 20 lines with 1).

Version 1.0.66   February 12, 2009
Having finally learned how to write vignettes, have started to write them.
Modififed ICLUST to default to show labels on graphics
Modified factor.congruence to allow comparisons for omega solutions
Modified error bars to allow for raw data input.

Version 1.0.65  February 7, 2009
Released to CRAN (basically 1.0.64 with two errors in the Rd.files fixed).
Version 1.0.64  February 2, 2009

Added the data set Thurstone to the bifactor data set.
Minor corrections to omega, structure.graph and structure.sem functions to allow for ease of use as a front end to sem.

Version 1.0.63  January 22, 2009

Added a tutorial for using psych as a front end to sem

Added structure.graph and structure.sem to create sem commands to represent specified structures.
Added structure.list and phi.list to facilitate making structural models.

Added Promax to ease the finding of promax interfactor correlations.
As a consequence, corrected the use of promax in VSS and omega so it actually works.

Added structure.graph to draw sem/regression figures. I am still having a problem with making the X latent variables line up if they are correlated.

correction to principal for case of rotation not being defined

correction to winsor so that it does not sort the returned vector (this would cause problems in the case of winsorizing matrices or data.frames.  It was not a problem for winsor.mean

reorganization of print.psych function to make for a clearer structure

Version 1.0.62    January 2009
(version number jump because of problems getting through windows tests on CRAN)

added confidence intervals to ICC
renamed a number of functions to make it easier
e.g., the sim.xxx family of simulations
          cortest.xxx family of tests of correlations

added super.matrix function
added data sets for bifactor problems
