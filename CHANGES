Change file for package psych



Version 1.0.64  February 2, 2009

Added the data set Thurstone to the bifactor data set.
Minor corrections to omega, structure.graph and structure.sem functions to allow for ease of use as a front end to sem.

Version 1.0.63  January 22, 2009

Added a tutorial for using psych as a front end to sem

Added structure.graph and structure.sem to create sem commands to represent specified structures.
Added structure.list and phi.list to facilitate making structural models.

Added Promax to ease the finding of promax interfactor correlations.
As a consequence, corrected the use of promax in VSS and omega so it actually works.

Added structure.graph to draw sem/regression figures. I am still having a problem with making the X latent variables line up if they are correlated.

correction to principal for case of rotation not being defined

correction to winsor so that it does not sort the returned vector (this would cause problems in the case of winsorizing matrices or data.frames.  It was not a problem for winsor.mean

reorganization of print.psych function to make for a clearer structure

Version 1.0.62    January 2009
(version number jump because of problems getting through windows tests on CRAN)

added confidence intervals to ICC
renamed a number of functions to make it easier
e.g., the sim.xxx family of simulations
          cortest.xxx family of tests of correlations

added super.matrix function
added data sets for bifactor problems
