	Abstract = {The performance of four rules for determining the number of components to retain (Kaiser's eigenvalue greater than unity, Cattell's SCREE, Bartlett's test, and Velicer's MAP) was investigated across four systematically varied factors (sample size, number of variables, number of components, and component saturation). Ten sample correlation matrices were generated from each of 48 known population correlation matrices representing the combinations of conditions. The performance of the SCREE and MAP rules was generally the best across all situations. Bartlett's test was generally adequate except when the number of variables was close to the sample size. Kaiser's rule tended to severely overestimate the number of components. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Evidence is presented that parallel analysis is one of the most accurate factor retention methods while also being one of the most underutilized in management and organizational research. Therefore, a step-by-step guide to performing parallel analysis is described, and an example is provided using data from the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. Recommendations for making factor retention decisions are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Horn's parallel analysis (PA) is the method of consensus in the literature on empirical methods for deciding how many components/factors to retain. Different authors have proposed various implementations of PA. Horn's seminal 1965 article, a 1996 article by Thompson and Daniel, and a 2004 article by Hayton, Allen, and Scarpello all make assertions about the requisite distributional forms of the random data generated for use in PA. Readily available software is used to test whether the results of PA are sensitive to several distributional prescriptions in the literature regarding the rank, normality, mean, variance, and range of simulated data on a portion of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (Pennell et al., 2004) by varying the distributions in each PA. The results of PA were found not to vary by distributional assumption. The conclusion is that PA may be reliably performed with the computationally simplest distributional assumptions about the simulated data.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~It is suggested that if Guttman's latent-root-one lower bound estimate for the rank of a correlation matrix is accepted as a psychometric upper bound, following the proofs and arguments of Kaiser and Dickman, then the rank for a sample matrix should be estimated by subtracting out the component in the latent roots which can be attributed to sampling error, and least-squares capitalization on this error, in the calculation of the correlations and the roots. A procedure based on the generation of random variables is given for estimating the component which needs to be subtracted.},

	Abstract = {Historically, interesting psychological theories have been phrased in terms of correlation coefficients, which are standardized covariances, and various statistics derived from them. Methodological practice over the last 40 years, however, has suggested it is necessary to transform such theories into hypotheses on covariances and statistics derived from them. This complication turns out to be unnecessary, because the methodology now exists to test hypotheses on latent structures of correlations directly. Two examples are given. Limitations of correlation structures are also noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {Many users of the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992) are unaware that Saucier (1998) developed item cluster subcomponents for each broad domain of the instrument similar to the facets of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992). In this study, the author examined the following: the replicability of the subcomponents in young adult university and middle-aged community samples; whether item keying accounted for additional covariance among items; subcomponent correlations with a measure of socially desirable responding; subcomponent reliabilities; and subcomponent discriminant validity with respect to age-relevant criterion items expected to reflect varying associations with broad and narrow traits. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that all subcomponents were recoverable across samples and that the addition of method factors representing positive and negative item keying improved model fit. The subcomponents correlated no more with a measure of socially desirable responding than their parent domains and showed good average reliability. Correlations with criterion items suggested that subcomponents may prove useful in specifying which elements of NEO-FFI domains are more or less related to variables of interest. The author discusses their use for enhancing the precision of findings obtained with NEO-FFI domain scores. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Personality, motivation, and performance: a theory of the relationship between individual differences and information processing. Psychol. Rev. 91, 153-184], was examined using behavioral, subjective, and effort-related physiological measures. Eighteen approach-driven participants and 18 avoidance-driven participants were selected based on their motive to achieve success scores and their motive to avoid failure scores. A 2x3 factorial design was used, with three levels of task difficulty. As expected, approach-driven participants performed better and had a stronger decrease of midfrequency band of heart rate variability than avoidance-driven participants, especially during the difficult task. These results support the interactive effect of achievement motivation and task difficulty on invested mental effort.},

The Big One was interpreted as a basic personality disposition that integrates the most general non-cognitive dimensions of personality.

	Abstract = {This review considers a common question in data analysis: What is the most useful way to analyze longitudinal repeated measures data? We discuss some contemporary forms of structural equation models (SEMs) based on the inclusion of latent variables. The specific goals of this review are to clarify basic SEM definitions, consider relations to classical models, focus on testable features of the new models, and provide recent references to more complete presentations. A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {Six different methods of computing factor scores were investigated in a simulation study. Population scores created from oblique factor patterns selected from the psychological literature served as the bases for the simulations, and the stability of the different methods was assessed through cross-validation in a subject-sampling model. Results from 5 evaluative criteria indicated that a simplified, unit-weighting procedure based on the factor score coefficients was generally superior to several unit-weighting procedures based on the pattern or structure coefficients. This simplified method of computing factor scores also compared favorably with an exact-weighting scheme based on the full factor score coefficient matrix. Results are discussed with regard to their potential impact on current practice, and several recommendations are offered.

	Abstract = {A variety of methods for computing factor scores can be found in the psychological literature. These methods grew out of a historic debate regarding the indeterminate nature of the common factor model. Unfortunately, most researchers are unaware of the indeterminacy issue and the problems associated with a number of the factor scoring procedures. This article reviews the history and nature of factor score indeterminacy. Novel computer programs for assessing the degree of indeterminacy in a given analysis, as well as for computing and evaluating different types of factor scores, are then presented and demonstrated using data from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Third Edition. It is argued that factor score indeterminacy should be routinely assessed and reported as part of any exploratory factor analysis and that factor scores should be thoroughly evaluated before they are reported or used in subsequent statistical analyses.

	Abstract = {An important problem in principal component analysis (PCA) is the estimation of the correct number of components to retain. PCA is most often used to reduce a set of observed variables to a new set of variables of lower dimensionality. The choice of this dimensionality is a crucial step for the interpretation of results or subsequent analyses, because it could lead to a loss of information (underestimation) or the introduction of random noise (overestimation). New techniques are proposed to evaluate the dimensionality in PCA. They are based on similarity measurements, singular value decomposition and permutation procedures. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the relative merits of the proposed approaches. Results showed that one method based on the RV coefficient is very accurate and seems to be more efficient than other existing approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The effects of a 3mg/kg body weight (BW) dose of caffeine were assessed on behavioral indices of response inhibition. To meet these aims, we selected a modified AX version of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), the stop task, and the flanker task. In three double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects experiments, these tasks were administered to healthy participants. While the results for the AX-CPT were indicative of improved response inhibition after caffeine, they might also reflect caffeine-induced changes in mechanisms other than response inhibition (e.g., attentional processes). The results for the stop task and flanker task were more straightforward. That is, the effects of caffeine on overall flanker performance and selective response suppression as revealed by distribution-analytical techniques were negligible. In the stop task a global effect of caffeine on processing speed was seen, rather than specific effects on response inhibition. Taken together, these experiments showed that both active and reactive inhibition were not significantly modulated by caffeine. The present results are linked to neural circuits that underlie inhibitory control and the role of caffeine-induced strategic changes.},

	Abstract = {We studied the effects of moderate amounts of caffeine on task switching and task maintenance using mixed-task (AABB) blocks, in which participants alternated predictably between two tasks, and single-task (AAAA, BBBB) blocks. Switch costs refer to longer reaction times (RT) on task switch trials (e.g. AB) compared to task-repeat trials (e.g. BB); mixing costs refer to longer RTs in task-repeat trials compared to single-task trials. In a double-blind, within-subjects experiment, two caffeine doses (3 and 5mg/kg body weight) and a placebo were administered to 18 coffee drinkers. Both caffeine doses reduced switch costs compared to placebo. Event-related brain potentials revealed a negative deflection developing within the preparatory interval, which was larger for switch than for repeat trials. Caffeine increased this switch-related difference. These results suggest that coffee consumption improves task-switching performance by enhancing anticipatory processing such as task set updating, presumably through the neurochemical effects of caffeine on the dopamine system.},

Smillie (this issue) (see record 2008-12732-002) shows the power of RST to address how we feel (Affect) and act (Behaviour) but ignores how we think (Cognition) and want (Desire). Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) needs to consider how cognitive framing and goal structures modify the basic approach and avoidance processes of human activity. Incorporating multilevel models of cognitive controls of affect and behaviour into RST has the potential to broaden its framework for applications to complex human endeavours.

	Abstract = {Traditional psychometric procedures can be inade quate for the measurement of dynamic constructs in longitudinal panel studies. This paper introduces an al ternative based on the longitudinal Guttman simplex (LGS) model, a measurement model developed espe cially for dynamic constructs measured longitudinally. The LGS is a model of cumulative, unitary develop ment. It is cumulative in the sense that as persons ac quire new skills (or abilities, or opinions), earlier ob tained skills are retained; it is unitary in the sense that all persons progress through a sequence of skills in the same skill order. CL, a consistency index that gives the researcher a measure of the extent to which the LGS model axioms are obeyed in a given dataset, is introduced. By making use of this consistency index, the researcher can develop scales uniquely sensitive to cumulative, unitary development. LGSCLUS, an explor atory procedure to find longitudinal Guttman scales in empirical datasets, is described. An artificial data study is reported, the purpose of which was to test the performance of LGSCLUS under controlled conditions. The artificial data study showed that, in general, LGSCLUS recovers longitudinal Guttman scales with a high degree of accuracy. There remains a need for measurement procedures for dynamic constructs exhib iting types of development other than cumulative and unitary.

Nested model comparisons via sequential chi-square difference tests are supported as meaningful and are consistent with the 4-step approach to model evaluation when models of the factor analytic simultaneous equation type are entertained. Other classes of models, such as generalized Bentler-Weeks or simplex models, can be similarly evaluated by a sequence of nested models, but this sequence may not be the proposed 4-step sequence beginning with a confirmatory factor model. Some problems with the use of a ``gold standard''indicator of a factor also are noted.},

@article{Hayduk:2000,
	Abstract = {It has been proposed that a clear separation of measurement from structural reasons for model failure can be obtained via a procedure testing 4 nested models: (a) a factor model, (b) a confirmatory factor model, (c) the anticipated structural equation model, and (d) possibly, a more constrained model. Advocates of the 4-step procedure contend that these nested models provide a trustworthy way of determining whether one's model is failing as a result of structural (conceptual) inadequacy, or as a result of measurement misspecification. We argue that measurement and structural issues can not be unambiguously separated by the 4 steps, and that the seeming separation is incomplete at best and illusory at worst. The prime difficulty is that the 4-step procedure is incapable of determining whether the proposed model contains the proper number of factors. As long as the number of factors is in doubt, measurement and structural assessments remain dubious and entwined. The assessment of model fit raises additional difficulties because the researcher is implicitly favoring of the null hypothesis, and the logic of the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) as a test of ``close fit''is inconsistent with the logic of the 4-step. These discussions question whether factor analysis can dependably determine the proper number of factors, and argue against the routine use of .05 as the probability target for structural equation model chi-square fit.},

	Abstract = {We examine some of the positions put forth in various arguments related to the proper number of factors and proper number of steps when using structural equation models. Although we agree with Hayduk and Glaser (2000) on a number of points, we do disagree on the nature of determining the number of factors in a model and in the use of the 2-step strategy. We see the issue in estimating structural equation models as fundamentally a problem of appropriately specifying a model based on our theoretical concerns, then appropriately diagnosing ills in our models in a manner that is least likely to lead us astray. We report summary results from sets of simulations and provide a detailed discussion of 1 attempt to respecify a model. Our conclusions point to the inherent difficulty in respecifying models that do not fit, the similarity in results regardless of using 1-step or 2-step strategies when estimating models with only minor misspecifications, and the value of the 2-step procedure to provide slightly better clues in our search for a better fitting model.},

One resolution uses Tucker's distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. Eight analyses of two sets of data demonstrate the procedures and results of a confirmatory study with statistical tests of some, but not all, relevant hypotheses in an investigation of the stability (invariance) hypothesis. The empirical results provide estimates, as substitutes for unavailable sampling formulations, of effects of variation in diagonal values, in method of factoring, and in samples of cases.

@article{lucke:05,
	Abstract = {Psychometric theory focuses primarily on tests that are homogeneous, measuring only one attribute of a psychosocial entity. However, the complexity of psychosocial behavior often requires tests that are heterogeneous, measuring more than one attribute. In this presentation, reliability and internal consistency are extended to heterogeneous tests under the rubric of congeneric test theory. The extensions show that reliability and internal consistency have very similar properties. Reliability and internal consistency are shown to be unique up to a linear transformation. Whereas internal consistency is a lower bound to reliability in the homogeneous case, it is a strict lower bound in the heterogeneous case. Reliability equals internal consistency if and only if the test is homogeneous and true-score equivalent. An analytic argument shows that neither reliability nor internal consistency can detect whether a test is homogeneous or heterogeneous. The reliability (internal consistency) of a heterogeneous test is the sum of the sub-tests' reliabilities (internal consistencies) plus the sum of reliabilities (internal consistencies) involving the correlations among the sub-tests. Higher-order tests are tests in which items measure first-order attributes, first-order attributes reflect second-order attributes, and so on. Reliability (internal consistency) can be partitioned into the sums of direct reliability (direct internal consistency) for the first-order attributes and indirect reliabilities (indirect internal consistencies) for the second- and higher-order attributes. Simple examples demonstrate that internal consistency may be a poor approximator to the reliability of congeneric tests. Given that reliability for congeneric tests can now be estimated by modern statistical software, the need for internal consistency is diminished. However, internal consistency may be useful in bounding or approximating reliability in general linear latent variable models. },

@article{McIntosh:2007,
	Abstract = { With seemingly few exceptions, current practice in structural equation modelling (SEM) aims at establishing close rather than exact fit between hypothetical models and observed data. This orientation has gone without serious challenge until the appearance of a sharp critique by Barrett (2007), who suggests discontinuing the use of approximate fit indices (AFIs) in SEM. The present article provides a commentary and elaboration on the key aspects of Barrett's position, and also supplies further practical guidance and methodological references to applied researchers, who may be motivated to significantly alter their modelling practices in order to address the issues he raises. I strongly support his calls for performing more detailed diagnostic examinations of model misfit when confronted with a significant chi-square ([chi]2) test statistic, rather than simply deferring to AFIs. However, I do not second the recommendation that assessments of a model's predictive accuracy (e.g., R2 values) can supplant a focused search for the reasons underlying significant global misfit. Accordingly, some misconceptions about the relationship between global model fit and predictive accuracy are pointed out, and modified advice is given to practitioners. Issues surrounding how to properly appraise a model yielding a non-significant [chi]2 are also discussed, as are concerns raised by Barrett about small sample size and power in SEM. It is concluded that AFIs offer little value-added in SEM practice, given the wide variety of available methods for performing detailed model assessments. However, I leave the issue of whether AFIs should be completely abandoned to future research.},

	Abstract = { In his target article (Barrett, 2007), Paul Barrett argues persuasively against continued use of approximate fit indices in SEM in relation to current thresholds for acceptable fit, given recent research that has cast doubt on the generality of these thresholds. He proposes greater use of the chi-square test of exact fit as an alternative, except in special circumstances. Apart from the problems with current fit thresholds, a further problem with fit indices is the lack of any direct relationship between the value of an index and the degree of misspecification in the model. In response to these problems, a procedure for using fit indices in the absence of thresholds is outlined here. The approach requires the investigator to specify acceptable levels of misspecification a priori, and then uses this information in a simulation procedure to develop a decision for retaining versus rejecting the model. It is argued that this approach is preferable to exclusive reliance on the chi-square test of exact fit. Comments on other points made in the target article are given.},

The quartimax results agree very closely with the solutions of Holzinger and Harman and of Eysenck, and reasonably well with the two simple structure analyses.

Reproduction of the factorial structure is sufficiently good to justify its use at least as the first stage of rotation.

The predicted correlation varies with time frame, response format, and items selected to define PA and NA. The observed correlation also varies with errors inherent in measurement. When the actual predictions of a bipolar model are considered and error is taken into account, there is little evidence for independence of what were traditionally thought opposites.

These allegedly robust empirical generalizations underlie various conceptual models of affect (such as those that posit an independence between positive and negative affect) and various scales of affect. The authors offer an alternative analysis: The correlation between two affects is a function of the angle between them within a circular ordering.

Until the recent introduction of a hierarchical model of the ASI by S. O. Lilienfeld, S. M. Turner, and R. G.

Background&nbsp;&nbsp;We argue that a bifactor analysis can complement traditional dimensionality investigations by: (a) providing an evaluation of the distortion that may occur when unidimensional models are fit to multidimensional data, (b) allowing researchers to examine the utility of forming subscales, and, (c) providing an alternative to non-hierarchical multidimensional models for scaling individual differences.    Method&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate our arguments, we use responses (N =&nbsp; 1,000 Medicaid recipients) to 16 items in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS{\copyright}2.0) survey.    Analyses&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic and item response theory models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) were estimated.    Results&nbsp;&nbsp;CAHPS{\copyright} items are consistent with both unidimensional and multidimensional solutions.

This paper comments on an article by Schmidt and Hunter [Intelligence 27 (1999) 183.], who argue that the correction for attenuation should be routinely used in theory testing. It is maintained that Schmidt and Hunter's arguments are based on mistaken assumptions. We discuss our critique of Schmidt and Hunter in terms of two arguments against a routine use of the correction for attenuation within the classical test theory framework: (1) corrected correlations do not, as Schmidt and Hunter claim, provide correlations between constructs, and (2) corrections for measurement error should be made using modern test theory models instead of the classical model. The arguments that Schmidt and Hunter advance in favor of the correction for attenuation can be traced to an implicit identification of true scores with construct scores. First, we show that this identification confounds issues of validity and issues of reliability. Second, it is pointed out that equating true scores with construct scores is logically inconsistent with the classical test theory model itself. Third, it is argued that the classical model is not suited for detecting the dimensionality of test scores, which severely limits the interpretation of the corrected correlation coefficients. It is concluded that most measurement problems in psychology concern issues of validity, and that the correction for attenuation within classical test theory does not help in solving them.},

Accurate empirical tests of theories and hypotheses are not possible unless the inevitable biases induced into data by measurement error are controlled for. Yet despite 90 years of recommendations from measurement theory and methodology, some still do not control for these biases in their research. This paper presents simple and direct demonstrations showing why basic measurement principles require that biases in data created by measurement error be removed and refutes commonly heard objections to the corrections for these biases. One factor contributing to resistance on the part of some researchers is the fact that most psychologists are not aware that measurement error is produced by real psychological processes that can be studied and understood. This paper describes those substantive psychological process and shows how each generates a different type of measurement error. We also show how different types of reliability estimates assess and calibrate different error processes and types of measurement error, leading directly to conclusions about which types of reliability estimates are appropriate for measurement error corrections in different research settings. Failure to control for biases induced by measurement error has retarded the development of cumulative research knowledge. It is our hope that this paper will contribute to removing these hobbles from psychological research.},

Without further assumption the reliability of a test is defined. Parallel measurements are then independently defined, and the concept of replication is explicated. The derived axioms of the classical test theory model are then stated in a refined form of Woodbury's stochastic process notation, and the basic results of this model are derived. The assumptions of experimental independence, homogeneity of error distribution, and conditional independence are related to the classical model and to each other. Finally, a brief sketch of some stronger models assuming the independence of error and true scores or the existence of higher-order moments of error distributions or those making specific distributional assumptions is given.},

This condition is then also shown to be closely related to the unit rank assumption originally adopted by Kuder and Richardson in the derivation of their formula 20. The assumption later adopted by Jackson and Ferguson and the one adopted by Gulliksen are shown to be related to the necessary and sufficient condition derived here.

First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score's reliability given the interitem covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test's internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals' test performance.

This has been shown in a series of studies employing different neurophysiological measurement methods and a broad range of different cognitive task demands. However, most of the studies dealing with the brain--IQ relationship used parameters of absolute or relative brain activation such as the event-related (de-)synchronization of EEG alpha activity, allowing for interpretations in terms of more or less brain activation when individuals are confronted with cognitively demanding tasks. In order to investigate the neural efficiency hypothesis more thoroughly, we also used measures that inform us about functional connectivity between different brain areas (or functional coupling, respectively) when engaged in cognitive task performance. Analyses reveal evidence that higher intelligence is associated with a lower brain activation (or a lower ERD, respectively) and a stronger phase locking between short-distant regions of the frontal cortex.

	Abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

The authors therefore examined the Big Five personality correlates of these 2 measures using facet scales from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) measure. Respondents were 220 university undergraduate volunteers. Significant sex differences were noted with respect to SDO and some facet scales.

To understand this contention, the definitions of MI and PI are reviewed, followed by results on the consistency between the two forms of invariance in the general case. The special parametric cases of factor analysis (strict factorial invariance) and linear regression analyses (strong regression invariance) are then described, along with findings on the inconsistency between the two forms of invariance in this context. Two numerical examples of inconsistency are reviewed in detail. The impact of violations of MI on accuracy of selection is illustrated. Finally, reasons for the slow dissemination of work on invariance are discussed, and the prospects for altering this situation are weighed.  },

A common situation occurs when a battery of tests has been administered to samples of examinees from several populations.A very general model is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models (factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method yielding a large samplex 2 of goodness of fit. By computing several solutions under different specifications one can test various hypotheses.The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance, from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme, where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise comparable.},

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) Scale construction continues to be a popular activity among basic and applied personality researchers. We conducted a PsycINFO search of English-language journal articles published during the past 55 years that (1) included the keywords test construction, scale development, scale construction, or measure development and (2) also included the keyword personality. Using these criteria, our search revealed a total of 5,071 articles published since 1950, of which 3,609 (69.4%) have been published since 1985. Through the late 1980s and the 1990s, approximately 168 such articles, on average, were published each year, but this number has increased markedly in first half of this decade. Between the years 2000 and 2004, an average of 218 personality scale construction articles were published each year, representing a 30% increase as compared with the 15 years prior. Several points are notable from these data. First, approximately two-thirds of all personality scale construction articles have been published over the past 20 years, likely reflecting both a resurgence of personality-based research and the proliferation of psychology journals in general. Second, although stable between 1985 and 1999, the pace of such publications appears to be increasing of late. Moreover, even the most recent articles have used a wide variety of approaches to construct and validate personality measures, with many reporting inadequate or outdated methodology, suggesting that the need for sound scale construction resources has never been greater. Thus, the primary goal of this chapter is to review basic principles of personality scale construction and describe an integrative method for constructing objective personality measures under the broad umbrella of construct validity.

When astronomers measure the behavior of planets and stars, when molecular biologists assay the expression of hormones in cells, when medical doctors assess how much amniotic fluid is left late in a pregnancy, they all worry whether their measurement procedures provide the kind of information they are looking for--that is, is the information generally applicable and does it capture the phenomenon they are interested in? Across all these disciplines, reliability and validity are fundamental concepts that help researchers evaluate how well their measures work. Having a keen understanding of issues related to reliability and validity is important, and this chapter is intended to provide both historical and contemporary ideas about these key measurement issues. In addition, this chapter also provides answers to questions commonly asked by students of personality psychology, such as whether an alpha reliability of .50 is high enough, why we should care whether a scale is unidimensional, and what one should do to show that a measure is valid.

Using criteria established in the wake of the person-situation debate (D. T. Kenrick \& D. C. Funder, 1988), the authors evaluate the status of personality traits in animals. The animal literature provides strong evidence that personality does exist in animals. That is, personality ratings of animals: (a) show strong levels of interobserver agreement, (b) show evidence of validity in terms of predicting behaviors and real-world outcomes, and (c) do not merely reflect the implicit theories of observers projected onto animals.

First, we present a meta-analysis demonstrating a strong positive relationship between narcissism and impulsivity. Second, we review and reinterpret the literature on 3 hallmarks of narcissism: self-enhancement, aggression, and negative long-term outcomes. Our reinterpretation argues that impulsivity provides a more parsimonious explanation for at least some of narcissists' self-defeating behavior than do existing models. These 2 sources of evidence suggest that narcissists' quest for the status and recognition they so intensely desire is thwarted, in part, by their lack of the self-control necessary to achieve those goals.

This pattern seems to be based, at least in part, on widely held preconceptions about the costs of non-self-report methods, such as informant methods. Researchers seem to believe that informant methods are: (a) time-consuming, (b) expensive, (c) ineffective (i.e., informants will not cooperate), and (d) particularly vulnerable to faking or invalid responses. This article evaluates the validity of these preconceptions in light of recent advances in Internet technology, and proposes some strategies for making informant methods more effective. Drawing on data from three separate studies, I demonstrate that, using these strategies, informant reports can be collected with minimal effort and few monetary costs. In addition, informants are generally very willing to cooperate (e.g., response rates of 76-95%) and provide valid data (in terms of strong consensus and self-other agreement). Informant reports represent a mostly untapped resource that researchers can use to improve the validity of personality assessments and to address new questions that cannot be examined with self-reports alone.

EAR is a digital voice recorder that unobtrusively tracks people's real-world moment-to-moment interactions. It operates by periodically recording snippets of ambient sounds, including conversations, while participants go about their daily lives. In the default paradigm, participants wear the EAR for several days during their waking hours. A potential limitation of our analysis is that all participants were university students. The resulting homogeneity in the samples with regard to sociodemographic characteristics may have affected our estimates of daily word usage. We therefore conclude, on the basis of available empirical evidence, that the widespread and highly publicized stereotype about female talkativeness is unfounded.

Despite its popularity and demonstrated utility, the self-report method has been a frequent target of criticism from the early days of psychological assessment right up to the present. The psychological processes underlying an act of self-reporting are now understood to be exceedingly complex. Examination of these processes requires burrowing deep into the affective and cognitive substrates of personality. Among the challenging issues are the role of motives in self-perception, the applicability of performative models, the effectiveness of introspection, the degree of automaticity, and the meaning of nonresponding. The goal of this chapter is more limited: to provide a brief guide to nonexpert researchers interested in using the self-report method to assess personality. We begin by delineating three categories of self-reports. We then review the advantages and the disadvantages of the self-report method. Next, we examine the convergence of self-reports with other methods of assessing personality. Finally, we provide a practical guide to choosing a self-report instrument.

First, interest in process has always been strong among personality psychologists, but has grown recently as personality psychologists become increasingly interested not only in what personality is but also in how it works. Second, such advancement in understanding process is the hallmark of a mature science and reflects the field's growing self-confidence. Finally, advancement in describing processes will reveal the potential for personality change as well as promising opportunities to effect such change.

	Abstract = {The authors review the development of the modern paradigm for intelligence assessment and application and consider the differentiation between intelligence-as-maximal performance and intelligence-as-typical performance. They review theories of intelligence, personality, and interest as a means to establish potential overlap. Consideration of intelligence-as-typical performance provides a basis for evaluation of intelligence-personality and intelligence-interest relations. Evaluation of relations among personality constructs, vocational interests, and intellectual abilities provides evidence for communality across the domains of personality of J. L. Holland's (1959) model of vocational interests. The authors provide an extensive meta-analysis of personality-intellectual ability correlations, and a review of interest-intellectual ability associations. They identify 4 trait complexes: social, clerical/conventional, science/math, and intellectual/cultural. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {Raymond B. Cattell is not generally perceived to be a developmen- 
tal psychologist. However, his lengthy, highly systematic research 
program produced many conceptual, methodological, measurement, 
and data analysis tools for identifying and studying interindividual 
differences and similarities in intraindividual change patterns. Such 
issues and methods are among the key elements of the foundation on 
which the lifespan orientation to the study of d~eveloprnent 
rests. 
Therefore, one can see evidence of the integration of many of Cattell's 
contributions into the conduct of lifespan development research. In 
addition to conceptual and methodological innovations, Cattell's sub- 
stantive contributions, including personality and ability concepts and 
their accompanying, age-graded measurement devices, are also uti- 
lized to varying degrees by developmentalists. 
How valuable for developmental r~esearch 
have Cattell's contribu- 
tions been? The evidence sifted indicates that Cattell has not had a 
notable direct impact on traditional developmental research and 
theorizing, in part because he has not systematically investNed 
his own 
efforts in the study of developmental phenomena and issues per se. At 
a more general level, however, and particularly in relation to the 
lifespan orientation to the study af development, Cattell's multivariate 
correlational research program is indeed helping to shape current 
direction and practice.},

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) Longitudinal studies are fundamental to research on personality. Whether a particular aspect of personality is hypothesized to change over time or remain stable, it is longitudinal data that verify the answer. There is no substitute for longitudinal information in answering these questions; it is the gold standard when it comes to understanding consistency and change. However, researchers who use longitudinal data often meet with difficulty with respect to analyzing these sometimes complicated data. Longitudinal data analysis can be tricky. This chapter gives a broad overview of the most common types of data analysis that are used in longitudinal research on personality. It starts with some basic and more traditional ways of analyzing longitudinal data and then moves to more complex techniques. The analytic tools presented here are by no means exhaustive of the available techniques, but the reader is assured that these are the ones he or she will most likely encounter when reading the literature (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Compares Cattell's factor analytic approach to personality study with current modeling practices to provide a critical evaluation of Cattell's contributions to structural equation modeling. Four broad areas of structural equation modeling enterprise are distinguished: specification, estimation, comparison, and substance. Specification refers to the translation of verbal statements of a psychological hypothesis into a mathematical form. Cattell's specification equation is in the form of a linear regression equation, such that every manifest variable is equal to a weighted summation of several latent variables. Estimation refers to obtaining values for the unknown parameters from a selected set of available data. For Cattell, useful parameter estimates are obtained after factor rotation. Comparison refers to the comparing of proposed models and empirical data on mathematical and statistical grounds. Cattell clearly promotes the comparative study of fit using alternative models and methods. Substance refers to the link between evaluated models and psychological theory. Cattell's research results provide the strongest testimonial to his breadth and depth in defining, conceptualizing, and extracting psychological meaning from structural analyses. His grand modeling scheme can be illustrated by his recent attempts to pull together all of his resources into a model of a total personality system.

Two methods, one for single variables and one for factor patterns, are propounded whereby traits of dynamic modality, principally responses to incentives, can be distinguished from those of ability modality, which measure response to complexities. Operational criteria can be developed to discover those field characters which are incentives and those which are complexities. Dynamic traits and abilities can be recognized, whence temperamental traits are defined by exclusion. Thus, when in everyday life the same conditions of constancy of either incentives or complexities are set up, incentives and complexities can be manipulated to vary independently.

Basic methods in determining trait unities, both of dynamic traits and traits in general, are outlined.

	Abstract = {We studied the relationship between the phase and the amplitude of the circadian temperature rhythm using questionnaires that measure individual differences in personality variables, variables that relate to circadian rhythms, age and sex. The ambulatory core body temperature of 101 young men and 71 young women was recorded continuously over 6 days. The temperature minimum (Tmin) and amplitude (Tamp) were derived by fitting a complex cosine curve to each day's data for each subject. Participants completed the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), the Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) and the MMPI-2, scored for the Psychopathology-5 (PSY-5) personality variables. We found that the average Tmin occurred at 03.50 h for morning-types (M-types), 05.02 h for the neither-types and 06.01 h for evening-types (E-types). Figures were presented that could provide an estimate of Tmin given an individual's morningness-eveningness score or weekend wake time. The Tmin occurred at approximately the middle of the 8-h sleep period, but it occurred closer to wake in subjects with later Tmin values and increasing eveningness. In other words, E-types slept on an earlier part of their temperature cycle than M-types. This difference in the phase-relationship between temperature and sleep may explain why E-types are more alert at bedtime and sleepier after waking than M-types. The Tmin occurred about a half-hour later for men than women. Another interesting finding included an association between circadian rhythm temperature phase and amplitude, in that subjects with more delayed phases had larger amplitudes. The greater amplitude was due to lower nocturnal temperature.},

	Abstract = {Exercise can phase shift the circadian rhythms of young adults if performed at the right time of day. Similar research has not been done in older adults. This study examined the circadian phase-delaying effects of a single 3-h bout of low-intensity nocturnal exercise in older (n = 8; 55-73 yr old) vs. young (n = 8; 20-32 yr old) adults. The exercise occurred at the beginning of each subject's habitual sleep time, and subjects sat in a chair in dim light during the corresponding time in the control condition. The dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) was used as the circadian phase marker. The DLMO phase delayed more after the exercise than after the control condition. On average, the difference in phase shift between the exercise and control conditions was similar for older and young subjects, demonstrating that the phase-shifting effects of exercise on the circadian system are preserved in older adults. Therefore, exercise may potentially be a useful treatment to help adjust circadian rhythms in older and young adults.},

Modelling and computer simulations combined with empirical research are the traditional tools for the study of animal behavior. This exciting new book sets out to show how artificial ethology, or experimentation with animal-like robots, can add a new dimension to our understanding of behavioral questions. Thematic chapters scrutinizing major areas of research in animal behavior follow introductory chapters to modelling and robotics. Each thematic exploration is illustrated with case studies written by leading researchers in the field. From robotic lobsters to robotic 'monkeys', each case study brings the text to life, and gives a detailed description of a problem, approach, and robot application. This is a comprehensive introduction to the application of robotics in animal behavior and physiology.

	Abstract = { Behaviour is usually assumed to depend on the reach of a critical intensity--termed reactivity threshold--by its motivation. This view represents a simple, predictive theoretical framework in ethology and animal psychology. However, it is here argued that only the influence of an isolated motivation on behaviour can be explained that way; that such a view fails to account for behaviour when several motivations are jointly activated. Upon analysis, the classical theory of behaviour (CTB) proves to be under-specified and thus leads to three conceptual problems that make it logically inconsistent for the study of multiple motivations. A revision of the CTB, called anticipatory dynamics model (ADM), is then developed in order to bring a theoretical solution to these conceptual problems. The ADM hypothesizes that an organism's motivational interactions are due to the limitation of the organism's attentional resources.},

	Abstract = { A model of the interactive processes of cognition, motivation, emotion and action selection is proposed. Building on earlier theoretical models, it is argued that behaviour is determined by a combination of [`]on-line' direct controls and [`]off-line' cognitive controls. These result in different modes of behavioural control exhibiting different behavioural properties. Certain similar changes over phylogeny and ontogeny can be observed in terms of an altered relative weight between these controls. Under natural conditions, adaptation can be served by a change of weight between different levels of control as a function of circumstances. It is suggested that under abnormal conditions, e.g. in certain domestic environments, the change in weight of control can be such as to lead to behavioural pathology. Conversely, by a focus on different levels of control, the model can also give indications of good welfare practice.},

	Abstract = { Processes comparable in important respects to those underlying human conscious and non-conscious processing can be identified in a range of species and it is argued that these reflect evolutionary precursors of the human processes. A distinction is drawn between two types of processing: (1) stimulus-based and (2) higher-order. For [`]higher-order,' in humans the operations of processing are themselves associated with conscious awareness. Conscious awareness sets the context for stimulus-based processing and its end-point is accessible to conscious awareness. However, the mechanics of the translation between stimulus and response proceeds without conscious control. The paper argues that higher-order processing is an evolutionary addition to stimulus-based processing. The model's value is shown for gaining insight into a range of phenomena and their link with consciousness. These include brain damage, learning, memory, development, vision, emotion, motor control, reasoning, the voluntary versus involuntary debate, and mental disorder.},

	Abstract = {One of the most serious difficulties in the estimation of omegahierarchical ({omega}h) has not been previously studied. Although it is true that one can impose a set of identifying constraints on one's solution to derive an estimate of {omega}h in the two-group factor case, there is the potential for introducing bias into the process of estimating {omega}h, depending on the extent to which one's set of identifying constraints corresponds to the structure that actually underlies the scale. The authors demonstrate that this potential bias is only considerable when the ratio of the covariance between items loading on different group factors to the covariance between items loading on the same group factor is low. Four methods for estimating {omega}h are compared to each other, and the results suggest that Cronbach's alpha and a method based on the first unrotated principal factor should be rejected as estimates of {omega}h.

In this paper we show that the assumption of continuous multinormal observations can be relaxed in various ways. For continuous multivariate analysis most of the existing large- sample theory can be applied without assuming multivariate normality. We also develop several discrete multinormal models. The first one is the classical Pearson model, which results from discreticizing multinormal variables. The second one is inspired by correspondence analysis, and the third one by loglinear analysis. The models are presented in terms of correlation coefficients, and applied to the Spearman model of factor analyses using an example from political science.},

	Abstract = {Two well-known lower bounds to reliability in classical test theory, Guttman's lambda -sub-2 and Cronbach's coefficient alpha, are shown to be terms of an infinite series of lower bounds. All terms of this series are equal to the reliability if and only if the test is composed of items which are essentially tau-equivalent. Some practical examples, comparing the 1st 7 terms of the series, are offered. It appears that the 2nd term (lambda -sub-2) is generally worthwhile computing as an improvement of the 1st term (alpha), whereas going beyond the 2nd term is not worth the computational effort. Possibly an exception should be made for very short tests having widely spread absolute values of covariances between items. The relationship of the series and previous work on lower bound estimates for the reliability is briefly discussed. (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

This definition leads to a more complete analysis than does the conventional one; Spearman's contention is verified that the conventional approach---which was formulated by Yule---introduces unnecessary hypotheses. It is emphasized that at least two trials are necessary to estimate the reliability coefficient. This paper is devoted largely to developinglower bounds to the reliability coefficient that can be computed from but asingle trial; these avoid the experimental difficulties of making two independent trials. Six different lower bounds are established, appropriate for different situations. Some of the bounds are easier to compute than are conventional formulas, and all the bounds assume less than do conventional formulas. The terminology used is that of psychological and sociological testing, but the discussion actually provides a general analysis of the reliability of the sum ofn variables.},

	Abstract = {Although people pursue life outcomes because they believe that these outcomes will make them happy, research shows that external life circumstances have a surprisingly small effect on happiness and subjective well-being. In contrast, personality traits and other stable factors appear to play a more important role in happiness. Happiness is heritable, stable over time, and moderately to strongly associated with personality characteristics. Empirical support for these conclusions is reviewed, and more recent evidence that challenges strong interpretations of personality effects is discussed. Although the effects of personality are robust, long-term levels of happiness can and do change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Temperament models posit that the association is direct; instrumental models posit that the association is mediated by additional processes. Two experience sampling studies were conducted to test instrumental mechanisms that might underlie the effect. According to a mediation model, extraverts' greater social activity can account for their increased positive affect when compared to introverts. According to a person-by-situation interaction model, extraverts react more positively to social situations than do introverts, and this interaction can account for the association. Only weak support for the instrumental models was found; consistent with temperament models, a moderate direct association remained even after controlling for these effects.

This fact and the finding that test length is related to reliability may cause significant misinterpretations of measures when alpha is used as evidence that a measure is unidimensional. For multidimensional measures, use of alpha as the basis for corrections for attenuation causes overestimates of true correlation. Satisfactory levels of alpha depend on test use and interpretation. Even relatively low (e.g., .50) levels of criterion reliability do not seriously attenuate validity coefficients. When reporting intercorrelations among measures that should be discriminable, it is important to present observed correlations, appropriate measures of reliability, and correlations corrected for unreliability.},

The parts do not have to satisfy any statistical criteria like parallelism or-equivalence. If the parts are homogeneous in content (congeneric),i.e., if their true scores are linearly related and if sample size is large then the method described in this paper will give the precise value of the reliability parameter. If the homogeneity condition is violated then underestimation will typically result. However, the estimate will always be at least as accurate as coefficient and Guttman's lower bound 3 when the same data are used. An application to real data is presented by way of illustration. Seven different splits of the same test are analyzed. The new method yields remarkably stable reliability estimates across splits as predicted by the theory. One deviating value can be accounted for by a certain unsuspected peculiarity of the test composition. Both coefficient and 3 would not have led to the same discovery.},

	Abstract = {Research on psychopathology is at a historical crossroads. New technologies offer the promise of lasting advances in our understanding of the causes of human psychological suffering. Making the best use of these technologies, however, requires an empirically accurate model of psychopathology. Much current research is framed by the model of psychopathology portrayed in current versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Although the modern DSMs have been fundamental in advancing psychopathology research, recent research also challenges some assumptions made in the DSM--for example, the assumption that all forms of psychopathology are well conceived of as discrete categories. Psychological science has a critical role to play in working through the implications of this research and the challenges it presents. In particular, behavior-genetic, personality, and quantitative-psychological research perspectives can be melded to inform the development of an empirically based model of psychopathology that would constitute an evolution of the DSM.

	Abstract = {(from the jacket) Traditionally, personality and psychopathology have been distinct areas of inquiry: personality psychologists are more likely to study the former and clinical psychologists the latter. Yet, in spite of this historical divide, a number of influential research programs are bridging the gap between these two areas. Demonstrating how the scientific study of individual differences can enhance our understanding of clinical problems--and vice versa--this is a timely and authoritative work. A diverse array of studies is presented, including some that begin with the notion of basic temperaments or traits and examine their links to mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Others are grounded in a psychodynamic perspective on character structure and its consequences for interpersonal relationships and individual functioning. Still others shed new light on the fundamental neurobehavioral and genetic systems that underlie personality and explore how these systems are involved in risk for maladaptive behavior. Each chapter concisely reviews the literature on the topic at hand, describes the historical and theoretical underpinnings of the author's research, discusses key methodological challenges, and elucidates major findings. Throughout, the limits of available knowledge are considered and key directions for future investigation are identified. Of particular interest to clinicians, several chapters address implications for the development of effective interventions. Uniquely integrative and up to date, this volume will appeal to researchers, clinicians, and students in clinical psychology, personality, psychiatry, and social work. It could also serve as a text in graduate-level courses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {The authors articulate an expanded dimensional model of personality pathology to better account for symptoms of DSM-defined Cluster A personality disorders. Two hundred forty participants (98 firstdegree relatives of probands with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 92 community control participants, and 50 first-degree relatives of probands with bipolar disorder) completed a dimensional personality pathology questionnaire, a measure of schizotypal characteristics, and Chapman measures of psychosis proneness. Scales from all questionnaires were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation. A 5-factor structure of personality pathology emerged from the analyses, with Peculiarity forming an additional factor to the common 4-factor structure of personality pathology (consisting of Introversion, Emotional Dysregulation, Antagonism, and Compulsivity). These results support a 5-factor dimensional model of personality pathology that better accounts for phenomena encompassed by the Cluster A personality disorders in DSM-IV-TR (4th ed., text revised; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). This study has implications for the consideration of a dimensional model of personality disorder in DSM-V by offering a more comprehensive structural model that builds on previous work in this area.

Emotion theories adopting a functional approach to conceptualizing emotion seem to be the most promising for this purpose. In line with this approach, the authors review functions of emotions and potential disturbances with respect to the two interrelated regulatory processes in which emotions are involved: the intraindividual regulation of thoughts and behavior and the interindividual regulation in social interactions. The former is discussed in the theoretical framework of K. R. Scherer's component process model of emotion. On the basis of theoretical framework and empirical data, the authors formulate specific hypotheses concerning the expressivity and the symptomology of different groups of affectively disturbed patients. They outline potential disorders in the 2 regulatory systems that can be predicted in the context of the theoretical framework proposed here.

Measures of state and trait anxiety, and the development of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) are discussed first. The next part examines conceptual ambiguities in the constructs of anger, hostility, and aggression, briefly evaluates several instruments developed to assess anger and hostility, and describes the construction and validation of the State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS). The development and validation of the Anger Expression (AX) Scale and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) for assessing the experience, expression, and control of anger are considered next. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the utilization of measures of anxiety and anger in treatment planning and evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to provide an interpersonal account of trait anger. Given the interpersonal nature of anger, it is hypothesized that one's attitude towards others (in terms of low agreeableness) as well as one's beliefs about others' attitudes towards oneself (in terms of perceived low social esteem, the belief that one is lowly valued by others) contribute to trait anger. Additionally, it is argued that the effects of these interpersonal variables are amplified as people increasingly value their social relationships. To address these hypotheses, individual differences measures of the variables in question were administered (N = 360). The results confirmed the hypotheses: Both agreeableness and perceived social esteem were negatively related to trait anger, and the contribution of these variables in predicting trait anger was amplified as individuals attach more importance to social relations. Identical conclusions were reached when the analyses were performed when controlling for social desirability. Some implications for accounts of anger are discussed.

Measurement issues in the assessment of affect from vocal indicies are considered as well as how emotions are measured in lower animals.

	Abstract = { According to the realist interpretation, measurement commits us not just to the logically independent existence of things in space and time, but also to the existence of quantitatively structured properties and relations, and to the existence of real numbers, understood as relations of ratio between specific levels of such attributes. Measurement is defined as the estimation of numerical relations (or ratios) between magnitudes of a quantitative attribute and a unit. The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts.},

	Abstract = {Unlike Andrew Kyngdon, I think the issue he has addressed is most informatively considered outside the confines of the representational theory of measurement. Then it becomes clear that while the theory of conjoint measurement is about situations like that treated by the Rasch model, the former isolates a different feature of those situations to the latter. But, if the relevant attributes are already presumed to be quantitative, the perceived differences are minimized and the Rasch model might seem to be a version of conjoint measurement. It is on this basis that Rasch modellers pursue their paradoxical quest for measurement. However, because the relevant attributes are not actually known to be quantitative, use of the Rasch model to measure psychological attributes remains logically dependent upon the outcome of research involving the theory of conjoint measurement or something very similar.

It is shown that this model can be defined by only three assumptions in the framework of classical psychometric test theory (CTT). All other properties of the model, particularly the uncorrelated-ness of the trait with the method factors are logical consequences of the definition of the model. In the model proposed there are as many trait factors as different traits considered, but the number of method factors is one fewer than the number of methods included in an MTMM study. The covariance structure implied by this model is derived, and it is shown that this model is identified even under conditions under which other CFA-MTMM models are not. The model is illustrated by two empirical applications. Furthermore, its advantages and limitations are discussed with respect to previously developed CFA models for MTMM data.},

Mathematical representations of such clinical judges can often be constructed to capture critical aspects of their judgmental strategies. An analysis of the characteristics of such models permits a specification of the conditions under which the model itself will be a more valid predictor than will the man from whom it was derived. To ascertain whether such conditions are met in natural clinical decision making, data were reanalyzed from P. E. Meehl's (see 34:3) study of the judgments of 29 clinical psychologists attempting to differentiate psychotic from neurotic patients on the basis of their MMPI profiles. Results of these analyses indicate that for this diagnostic task models of the men are generally more valid than the men themselves. Moreover, the finding occurred even when the models were constructed on a small set of cases, and then man and model competed on a completely new set. (29 ref.)

Research summarized in P. Meehl's (1954) book on clinical vs statistical prediction and research stimulated in part by that book indicate that when a numerical criterion variable (e.g., graduate GPA) is to be predicted from numerical predictor variables, proper linear models outperform clinical intuition. Improper linear models are those in which the weights of the predictor variables are obtained by some nonoptimal method. The present article presents evidence that even such improper linear models are superior to clinical intuition when predicting a numerical criterion from numerical predictors. In fact, unit (i.e., equal) weighting is quite robust for making such predictions. The application of unit weights to decide what bullet the Denver Police Department should use is described; some technical, psychological, and ethical resistances to using linear models in making social decisions are considered; and arguments that could weaken these resistances are presented.

	Abstract = {A review of the literature indicates that linear models are frequently used in situations in which decisions are made on the basis of multiple codable inputs. These models are sometimes used (a) normatively to aid the decision maker, (b) as a contrast with the decision maker in the clinical vs statistical controversy, (c) to represent the decision maker "paramorphically" and (d) to "bootstrap" the decision maker by replacing him with his representation. Examination of the contexts in which linear models have been successfully employed indicates that the contexts have the following structural characteristics in common: each input variable has a conditionally monotone relationship with the output; there is error of measurement; and deviations from optimal weighting do not make much practical difference. These characteristics ensure the success of linear models, which are so appropriate in such contexts that random linear models (i.e., models whose weights are randomly chosen except for sign) may perform quite well. 4 examples involving the prediction of such codable output variables as GPA and psychiatric diagnosis are analyzed in detail. In all 4 examples, random linear models yield predictions that are superior to those of human judges. (52 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Professionals are frequently consulted to diagnose and predict human behavior; optimal treatment and planning often hinge on the consultant's judgmental accuracy. The consultant may rely on one of two contrasting approaches to decision-making--the clinical and actuarial methods. Research comparing these two approaches shows the actuarial method to be superior. Factors underlying the greater accuracy of actuarial methods, sources of resistance to the scientific findings, and the benefits of increased reliance on actuarial approaches are discussed.

In this article, the performance in terms of bias and sampling variance of 7 different effect-size indices for estimating the population standardized mean difference from a 2 x 2 table is examined by Monte Carlo simulation, assuming normal and nonnormal distributions. The results show good performance for 2 indices, one based on the probit transformation and the other based on the logistic distribution},

A separate meta-analysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading. It is shown that a ln(odds ratio) can be converted to effect size by dividing by 1.81. The validity of effect size, the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation, depends on comparable variation across studies. If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation, any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justified.

	Abstract = {Two models for study-to-study variation in a meta-analysis are presented, critiqued and illustrated. One, the fixed effects model, takes the studies being analysed as the universe of interest; the other, the random effects model, takes these studies as representing a sample from a larger population of possible studies. With emphasis on clinical trials, this paper illustrates in some detail the application of both models to three summary measures of the effect of an experimental intervention versus a control: the standardized difference for comparing two means, and the relative risk and odds ratio for comparing two proportions.

@article{bickel:75,
	Abstract = {Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects},

	Abstract = {The Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) comprises 10 basic values that guide behavior. The Schwartz model postulates that these 10 values build a circumplex structure. We examined the PVQ with respect to its dimensional structure using a representative sample (N = 1896) of the German population. The results of three widely used analyses were compared: multidimensional scaling, factorial analysis (with varimax rotation) of raw scores, and factorial analysis with ipsative values. Furthermore, rank correlations between the theoretically assumed circular distances and the empirical data were calculated. The analyses confirmed that the 10 dimensions of the PVQ can be depicted in a two-dimensional plane. However, the statistical techniques chosen yielded different arrangements of the 10 values in the plane. All statistical methods failed to confirm the circumplex structure postulated by Schwartz. Nevertheless, dimensions of higher order that condense the 10 dimensions can be derived for applications of the PVQ. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

IMs are multiple measures, where the data are collected, or are modified, in such a way that all S totals across the measures are equal. No clear consensus has been reached regarding the suitability of ipsative measures for factor analysis. The authors show analytically the fundamental problems that IMs impose for factor analysis. The expected value of the correlation between IMs is shown to equal -1/(k-1), where k is the number of measures. The rank of the resulting correlation matrix is reduced by one to k-1, and ipsativity alone produces k-1 artifactual bipolar factors, which will obscure any actual interrelations among the measures. If the data are known to be ipsative or if the tell-tale signs of ipsativity are seen, factor analysis should not be done. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Analysis of theoretical and actual data empirically verifies that factor analyses of ipsative data suffer from imposed multicollinearity. High intercorrelations between scoring types cannot be used as an estimate of alternate form reliability, and the lack of information retained in ipsative scores does not permit them to be used as substitutes for normative scores. An example of appropriate analysis of ipsative data using multinomial statistical techniques is provided. These techniques are more appropriate because ipsative scores contain only categorical information across individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Simple structure can be considered optimal if a (usually large) number of pattern elements is exactly zero.

In the present paper the weighting procedure proposed by Cureton \& Mulaik (1975) is applied to Direct Oblimin (Clarkson \& Jennrich, 1988), and the rotation method obtained is called Weighted Oblimin. It has been tested on artificial complex data and real data, and the results seem to indicate that, even though Direct Oblimin rotation fails when applied to complex data, Weighted Oblimin gives good results if a variable with complexity one can be found for each factor in the pattern. Although the weighting procedure proposed by Cureton \& Mulaik is based on Landahl's (1938) expression for orthogonal factors, Weighted Oblimin seems to be adequate even with highly oblique factors. The new rotation method was compared to other rotation methods based on the same weighting procedure and, whenever a variable with complexity one could be found for each factor in the pattern, Weighted Oblimin gave the best results. When rotating a simple empirical loading matrix, Weighted Oblimin seemed to slightly increase the performance of Direct Oblimin.},

The consequences of dichotomization for measurement and statistical analyses are illustrated and discussed. The use of dichotomization in practice is described, and justifications that are offered for such usage are examined.

	Abstract = {Analysis of continuous variables sometimes proceeds by selecting individuals on the basis of extreme scores of a sample distribution and submitting only those extreme scores to further analysis. This sampling method is known as the extreme groups approach (EGA). EGA is often used to achieve greater statistical power in subsequent hypothesis tests. However, there are several largely unrecognized costs associated with EGA that must be considered. The authors illustrate the effects EGA can have on power, standardized effect size, reliability, model specification, and the interpretability of results. Finally, the authors discuss alternative procedures, as well as possible legitimate uses of EGA. The authors urge researchers, editors, reviewers, and consumers to carefully assess the extent to which EGA is an appropriate tool in their own research and in that of others.

	Abstract = {Proper use of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) requires the researcher to make a series of careful decisions. Despite attempts by Floyd and Widaman (1995), Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, and Strahan (1999), and others to elucidate critical issues involved in these decisions, examples of questionable use of EFA are still common in the applied factor analysis literature. Poor decisions regarding the model to be used, the criteria used to decide how many factors to retain, and the rotation method can have drastic consequences for the quality and meaningfulness of factor analytic results. One commonly used approach--principal components analysis, retention of components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, and varimax rotation of these components--is shown to have potentially serious negative consequences. In addition, choosing arbitrary thresholds for factor loadings to be considered large, using single indicators for factors, and violating the linearity assumptions underlying EFA can have negative consequences for interpretation of results. It is demonstrated that, when decisions are carefully made, EFA can yield unambiguous and meaningful results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Domain-sampling principles provide a fundamental conception and definition of the communality. This definition may be alternatively stated in eight different ways. Three definitions lead to precise formulas that determine thetrue value of the communality: (i) from thek necessary and sufficient dimensions derived by iterated factoring, (ii) from then ‚{\"A}{\`\i}1 remaining variable-domains, and (iii) fromk' multiple clusters of then variables. Seven definitions provide approximation formulas: (i) one from thek dimensions as initially factored, (ii) one from then ‚{\"A}{\`\i}1 remaining variables, and (iii) five from a single cluster. Rank of the matrix is not a desiratum in some definitions. Using an example designed by Guilford to illustrate multiple-factor analysis, applications of the formulas based on the three precise definitions recover the true communalities, and five approximation formulas each gives values closer than thead hoc estimates usually employed in factor analysis.},

The following theorems are applicable to a battery ofn tests which are describable in terms ofr common factors, with orthogonal reference vectors.1. The communality of a testj is equal to the square of the multiple correlation of testj with ther reference vectors.2. The communality of a testj is equal to the square of the multiple correlation of testj with ther reference vectors and then‚{\"A}{\^\i}1 remaining tests. Corollary: The square of the multiple correlation of a testj with then‚{\"A}{\^\i}1 remaining tests is equal to or less than the communality of testj. It cannot exceed the communality.3. The square of the multiple correlation of a testj with then‚{\"A}{\^\i}1 remaining tests equals the communality of testj if the group of tests containsr statistically independent ests teach with a communality of unity.4. With correlation coefficients corrected for attenuation, when the number of tests increases indefinitely while the rank of the correlational matrix remains unchanged, the communality of a testj equals the square of the multiple correlation of testj with then‚{\"A}{\^\i}1 remaining tests.5. With raw correlation coefficients, it is shown in a special case that the square of the multiple correlation of a testj with then‚{\"A}{\^\i}1 remaining tests approaches the communality of testj as a limit when the number of tests increases indefinitely while the rank of correlational matrix remains the same.

The Thurstonians' emphasis on the development of factor analysis as an exploratory methodology was not new with them but was taken from British statisticians and psychologists who preceded them, whose literature the Thurstonians otherwise tended to ignore. The Thurstonians' rejection of general factors and focus on rotation to simple structure reflected an attempt to avoid statistical artifact and to identify factors with psychological substance. Much of the literature on factor analysis inPsychometrika concerned solving technical problems in the exploratory factor analysis method. Factor analysis took a major shift in direction in the 1970's with the development of confirmatory methodologies, many of which now receive greater attention than the method of exploratory factor analysis, most of the problems of which are now resolved.},

	Abstract = { Abstract Scale construction is a growth enterprise in the psychological literature. Unfortunately, many measures promise much but are severely limited by the inadequacies of their conceptualization and execution. In this paper, a model for developing psychological scales is presented that is rooted in the traditions of construct validity and classical test theory but informed by modern psychometric methods. Construct validity is conceptualized as a guiding principle in each of three phases of scale development, focused on (i) construct conceptualization and development of the initial item pool, (ii) item selection and structural validity, and (iii) assessment of external validity vis-a-vis other measures and relevant nontest criteria. },

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine whether athletes of different sports clustered in meaningful ways, based upon their intensity, direction and frequency of cognitive and somatic anxiety using hierarchical cluster analysis, and to compare the subgroups of athletes on trait anxiety, perfectionism and self-confidence. One hundred and sixty six male and female athletes completed the Sport-Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Sport Anxiety Scale and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 Revised including direction and frequency scales. Results revealed five-clusters labelled "anxious facilitators", "anxious debilitators", "low anxious facilitators", "low anxious debilitators" and "ruminator debilitators". Clusters differed significantly on concentration disruptions, trait somatic anxiety, worry, concern over mistakes, perceived parental pressure, and intensity and frequency of self-confidence. The importance of considering all dimensions of anxiety simultaneously when examining the functional nature of the construct and the five-clusters are discussed.

	Abstract = {Two robustness criteria are presented that are applicable to general clustering methods. Robustness and stability in cluster analysis are not only data dependent, but even cluster dependent. Robustness is in the present paper defined as a property of not only the clustering method, but also of every individual cluster in a data set. The main principles are: (a) dissimilarity measurement of an original cluster with the most similar cluster in the induced clustering obtained by adding data points, (b) the dissolution point, which is an adaptation of the breakdown point concept to single clusters, (c) isolation robustness: given a clustering method, is it possible to join, by addition of g points, arbitrarily well separated clusters? Results are derived for k-means, k-medoids (k estimated by average silhouette width), trimmed k-means, mixture models (with and without noise component, with and without estimation of the number of clusters by BIC), single and complete linkage.

	Abstract = {Model-based cluster analysis is a new clustering procedure to investigate population heterogeneity utilizing finite mixture multivariate normal densities. It is an inferentially based, statistically principled procedure that allows comparison of nonnested models using the Bayesian information criterion to compare multiple models and identify the optimum number of clusters. The current study clustered 36 young men and women on the basis of their baseline heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), chronic alcohol use, and reasons for drinking. Two cluster groups were identified and labeled the high alcohol risk and normative groups. Compared to the normative group, individuals in the high alcohol risk group had higher levels of alcohol use and more strongly endorsed disinhibition and suppression reasons for use. The high alcohol risk group showed significant HRV changes in response to positive and negative emotional and appetitive picture cues, compared to neutral cues. In contrast, the normative group showed a significant HRV change only to negative cues. Findings suggest that individuals with autonomic self-regulatory difficulties may be more susceptible to heavy alcohol use and use of alcohol for emotional regulation.

An alternative theory of psychological components is presented--concepts, and motivational and emotional dispositions, existing in large numbers, manifesting functional independence, combining in complex, not necessarily summative ways, displaying relatively indeterminate weights in producing a reaction, possessing form, content, retentivity, and degree of generality as definitive features. Each component originates in a psychological relational field consisting of an external environmental field and a conceptual background, and requires as a necessary condition for emergence an adequate somatic constitution. Psychological tests are samples of such components from an a priori defined universe or domain of components. Variation of an individual on different forms of a test is due not to chance but to non-identity of the components sampled by each form. Knowledge of the psychological components and of their causes gives a rationale for the intercorrelation between tests or behavior samples.

A method is presented for constructing such tests from items whose intercorrelations are not too high. Under certain restrictions the saturation, defined as the proportion of inter-item covariance to total variance, is maximized for each subtest. The nucleus of each subtest is three items with high covariancesinter se. All items which will lower the saturation are discarded; the one item is added which will maximize the saturation of the resultant test. This process is repeated until all the items are included or discarded for that subtest. If the correlation between any such subtests approaches the geometric mean of their saturations, their items form a new pool for one or more subtests.

	Abstract = {The epistemological status of factors-that is, components, common factors, and image factors-is briefly discussed. Implications for the number of factors problem, for varying views of factor analysis, and for the particular factor analytic model employed are noted; and the rationales under- lying the best known decision rules regarding the correct number of factors are discussed. The paper presents the results of a study in which reanalyses were performed on 17 correlation matrices found in the literature, and eight well-known rules and one new rule for determining the correct number of factors were applied. The rules are compared in light of the factor analytic model implied in each case, and some implications for practice are noted.},

	Abstract = {This article examines effects of sample size and other design features on correspondence between factors obtained from analysis of sample data and those present in the population from which the samples were drawn. The authors extend earlier work on this question by examining these phenomena in the situation in which the common factor model does not hold exactly in the population. They present a theoretical framework for representing such lack of fit and examine its implications in the population and sample. Based on this approach it is hypothesized that lack of fit of the model in the population will not, on the average, influence recovery of population factors in analysis of sample data, regardless of degree of model error and regardless of sample size. Rather, such recovery will be affected only by phenomena related to sampling error which have been studied previously. These hypotheses are investigated and verified in 2 sampling studies, 1 using artificial data and 1 using empirical data of 55,085 Ss aged 15 yrs and older.

	Abstract = {The factor analysis literature includes a range of recommendations regarding the minimum sample size necessary to obtain factor solutions that are adequately stable and that correspond closely to population factors. A fundamental misconception about this issue is that the minimum sample size, or the minimum ratio of sample size to the number of variables, is invariant across studies. In fact, necessary sample size is dependent on several aspects of any given study, including the level of communality of the variables and the level of overdetermination of the factors. The authors present a theoretical and mathematical framework that provides a basis for understanding and predicting these effects. The hypothesized effects are verified by a sampling study using artificial data. Results demonstrate the lack of validity of common rules of thumb and provide a basis for establishing guidelines for sample size in factor analysis.

In the present investigation, three methods of factor extraction were studied as applied to 54 simulated correlation matrices which varied in proportion of variance derived from a major factor domain, number of factors in the major domain, and closeness of the simulation procedure to the factor analysis structural model. While the factor extraction methods differed little from one another in quality of results for matrices more dissimilar to the factor analytic model, major differences in quality of results were associated with fewer factors in the major domain, higher proportion of variance from the major domain, and closeness of the simulation procedure to the factor analysis structural model.},

	Abstract = {Two independent methods, employing 12 PhD psychologists and 4 doctoral candidates as judges, were used to test the hypothesis that a circular (circumplex) model would be valid to represent the structure of interpersonal personality traits. In Method 1, 223 trait terms were selected from a larger domain of interpersonal traits on the basis of explicit criteria. Similarity ratings obtained through the use of a modified paired-comparison method empirically located each of these terms on a circle. Method 2, utilizing factor analysis of semantic differential ratings of a sample of 40 of these terms, produced an essentially empirical circular ordering. Results support the hypothesis. Implications for the issue of situationism vs interactionism, for implicit personality theory, and for personality test construction are discussed.

	Abstract = {Abstract\~{}\~{}Structural models that yield circumplex inequality patterns for the elements of correlation matrices are reviewed. Particular attention is given to a stochastic process defined on the circle proposed by T. W. Anderson. It is shown that the Anderson circumplex contains the Markov Process model for a simplex as a limiting case when a parameter tends to infinity.Anderson's model is intended for correlation matrices with positive elements. A replacement for Anderson's correlation function that permits negative correlations is suggested. It is shown that the resulting model may be reparametrzed as a factor analysis model with nonlinear constraints on the factor loadings. An unrestricted factor analysis, followed by an appropriate rotation, is employed to obtain parameter estimates. These estimates may be used as initial approximations in an iterative procedure to obtain minimum discrepancy estimates.Practical applications are reported.},

	Abstract = {Reports the development and validation of a scale designed to measure global life satisfaction, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Among the various components of subjective well-being, the SWLS is narrowly focused to assess global life satisfaction and does not tap related constructs such as positive affect or loneliness. Data from administrations of the SWLS to groups of 176 and 163 undergraduates and 53 elderly Ss (average age 75 yrs) are presented. The SWLS was shown to have favorable psychometric properties, including high internal consistency and high temporal reliability. Scores on the SWLS correlated moderately to highly with other measures of subjective well-being (e.g., Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale) and correlated predictably with specific personality characteristics. It is contended that the SWLS is suitable for use with different age groups. Other potential uses of the scale are discussed. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~A simple modification substantially simplifies the use of the gradient projection (GP) rotation algorithms of Jennrich (2001, 2002). These algorithms require subroutines to compute the value and gradient of any specific rotation criterion of interest. The gradient can be difficult to derive and program. It is shown that using numerical gradients gives almost precisely the same results as using exact gradients. The resulting algorithm is very easy to use because the only problem specific code required is that needed to define the rotation criterion. The computing time is increased when using numerical gradients, but it is still very modest for most purposes. While used extensively elsewhere, numerical derivatives seem to be underutilized in statistics. },

	Abstract = {Abstract~~A very general algorithm for orthogonal rotation is identified. It is shown that when an algorithm parameter is sufficiently large the algorithm converges monotonically to a stationary point of the rotation criterion from any starting value. Because a sufficiently large is in general hard to find, a modification that does not require it is introduced. Without this requirement the modified algorithm is not only very general, but also very simple. Its implementation involves little more than computing the gradient of the rotation criterion. While the modified algorithm converges monotonically from any starting value, it is not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point. It, however, does so in all of our examples. While motivated by the rotation problem in factor analysis, the algorithms discussed may be used to optimize almost any function of a not necessarily square column-wise orthonormal matrix. A number of these more general applications are considered. Empirical examples show that the modified algorithm can be reasonably fast, but its purpose is to save an investigator's effort rather than that of his or her computer. This makes it more appropriate as a research tool than as an algorithm for established methods.},

The algorithm has two steps. The first is to compute the gradient of the rotation criterion and the second is to project this onto a manifold of matrices with unit length columns. For this reason it is called a gradient projection algorithm. Because the projection step is very simple, implementation of the algorithm involves little more than computing the gradient of the rotation criterion which for many applications is very simple. It is proven that the algorithm is strictly monotone, that is as long as it is not already at a stationary point, each step will decrease the value of the criterion. Examples from a variety of areas are used to demonstrate the algorithm, including oblimin rotation, target rotation, simplimax rotation, and rotation to similarity and simplicity simultaneously. While it may be, the algorithm is not intended for use as a standard algorithm for well established problems, but rather as a tool for investigating new methods where its generality and simplicity may save an investigator substantial effort.},

A number of solutions have been proposed, none of which is totally satisfactory. An alternative solution which employs a matrix of partial correlations is considered. No components are extracted after the average squared partial correlation reaches a minimum. This approach gives an exact stopping point, has a direct operational interpretation, and can be applied to any type of component analysis. The method is most appropriate when component analysis is employed as an alternative to, or a first-stage solution for, factor analysis.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~It is proposed that a satisfactory criterion for an approximation to simple structure is the minimization of the sums of cross-products (across factors) ofsquares of factor loadings. This criterion is completely analytical and yields a unique solution; it requires no plotting, nor any decisions as to the clustering of variables into subgroups. The equations involved appear to be capable only of iterative solution; for more than three or four factors the computations become extremely laborious but may be feasible for high-speed electronic equipment. Either orthogonal or oblique solutions may be achieved. For illustrations, the Johnson-Reynolds study of flow and selection factors and the Thurstone box problem are reanalyzed. The presence of factorially complex tests produces a type of hyperplanar fit which the investigator may desire to adjust by graphical rotations; the smaller the number of such tests, the closer the criterion comes to approximating simple structure.},

The eigenvalues from both matrices are plotted to determine the number of factors. However, predicting the size of the eigenvalues from the random matrices and determining their distribution is complicated and could entail expensive computer programming. To make the parallel analysis procedure easy to use, regression equations for predicting the logarithms of the latent roots of random correlation matrices, with squared multiple correlations on the diagonal, are presented. The correlation matrices were derived from distributions of normally distributed random numbers. The results of this method are excellent, with multiple correlation coefficients ranging from .9948 to .9992. When using these data, combined with observation of breaks in the curve of the latent roots, the investigator has a more objective and valid basis for deciding on the number of factors to rotate and interpret than previously has been available.

	Abstract = {Asserts, through empirical, numerical, geometric, and algebraic demonstrations, that the positive correlations predicted by C.S. Spearman's (1927) hypothesis (significant mean White-Black IQ differences reflect differences in g, general factor common to all complex tests of mental ability) are psychometric artefacts. It is argued these are artefacts which also arise (1) with measures that have nothing to do with general ability, and (2) with any set of moderately correlated random data, once the sample is split into high and low groups. This interpretation predicts that if sample sizes differ substantially, the correlation will be larger for the 1st principal component of the larger group. This prediction is demonstrated in simulated and real data sets, including toy data from (1969) study of Head Start impact on Black and White children, and A. R. Jensen's (1985) reanalysis of intelligence test data. The author states that positive Spearman hypothesis correlations can be discounted as artefacts under 2 distinct interpretations, and concludes they are a tautological consequence of the facts that IQ test subtests correlate positively, and that Blacks score lower than Whites on these tests. It is concluded they reveal nothing about the nature of i- g and Black-White differences, and do not warrant any of the extrapolations derived from them, including Jensen's.

@incollection{maccallum:07,
	Abstract = {(from the chapter) A fundamental principle inherent in any application of factor analysis is that a factor analysis model is not an exact representation of real-world phenomena. Such a model, at least in any parsimonious form, is always wrong to some degree, even in the population. There is a variety of ways in which such models may be incorrect. For example, most factor analysis models specify a linear influence of latent variables on measured variables, when in fact that relationship may be nonlinear in the real world. Factor analysis models also attempt to account for relationships among measured variables using a small number of common factors and are not capable of fully representing the undoubtedly large number of minor common factors that influence measured variables and account in part for their intercorrelations. There are many other sources of error in such models. At best, a factor analysis model is an approximation of real-world phenomena. Of course this is the nature of scientific models in general and has been discussed frequently in a variety of literatures. In our own field, Cudeck and Henly (1991) emphasized '...no model is completely faithful to the behavior under study. Models usually are formalizations of processes that are extremely complex. It is a mistake to ignore either their limitations or their artificiality. The best one can hope for is that some aspect of a model may be useful for description, prediction, or synthesis" (p. 512). This view is now widely understood and accepted in our use of models for representing psychological processes and the structure in data gathered in psychological research, with factor analysis models being one special case. In the current chapter we consider two aspects of this principle. First, we examine the evolution of this idea in the history of factor analysis, focusing on how the view of the relationship between a factor analysis model and the real world has changed over the past 100 years. Second, we examine one important practical implication of this fundamental characteristic of such models: its relevance to the performance of different methods of parameter estimation. We demonstrate important differences among common estimation methods and account for these differences in terms of the nature of the correspondence between our models and the data we gather.

	Abstract = {In the traditional presentation of the common-factor model, measured variables are represented as exact linear combinations of common and unique factors. From the perspective that no mathematical model will fit real-world phenomena perfectly, it is suggested that this representation is problematic. It is not consistent with the phenomena it is intended to model, and it does not provide an adequate basis for understanding some issues inherent in factor analysis. An alternative representation of the model that incorporates a "lack-of-fit" term into the initial equation for the measured variables is proposed. Subsequent derivation of the covariance form of the model in the population and the sample yields a framework that allows for differentiation of various sources of error that arise in applications of the model. These developments provide a basis for study of some important issues such as model definition, parameter estimation, and sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Simulated data showed that alpha, though reasonably robust when computed on n components in moderately heterogeneous data, can under certain conditions seriously underestimate the reliability of a measure. Consequently, alpha, when used in corrections for attenuation, can result in nontrivial overestimation of the corrected correlation. Most of the coefficients studied, including lambda2, did not improve the estimate to any great extent when the data were heterogeneous. The exceptions were stratified alpha and maximal reliability, which performed well when the components were grouped into two subsets, each measuring a different factor, and maximized lambda4, which provided the most consistently accurate estimate of the reliability in all simulations studied.

Data were collected from 380 individuals administered the Test of Chemical Comprehension. Results show that the MSPLIT estimator was a better estimator of reliability than the usual L-sub-3 or L-sub-2. It overcame the problem of capitalization on sampling variation even on small sample sizes. The absolute magnitude of the underestimation of reliability by L-sub-3 was quite large. The use of simulation studies to explore the sampling distribution of MSPLIT estimators relative to other reliability coefficients is discussed.

	Abstract = {To assess the reliability of congeneric tests, specifically designed reliability measures have been proposed. This paper emphasizes that such measures rely on a unidimensionality hypothesis, which can neither be confirmed nor rejected when there are only three test parts, and will invariably be rejected when there are more than three test parts. Jackson and Agunwamba's (1977) greatest lower bound to reliability is proposed instead. Although this bound has a reputation for overestimating the population value when the sample size is small, this is no reason to prefer the unidimensionality-based reliability. Firstly, the sampling bias problem of the glb does not play a role when the number of test parts is small, as is often the case with congeneric measures. Secondly, glb and unidimensionality based reliability are often equal when there are three test parts, and when there are more test parts, their numerical values are still very similar. To the extent that the bias problem of the greatest lower bound does play a role, unidimensionality-based reliability is equally affected. Although unidimensionality and reliability are often thought of as unrelated, this paper shows that, from at least two perspectives, they act as antagonistic concepts. A measure, based on the same framework that led to the greatest lower bound, is discussed for assessing how close is a set of variables to unidimensionality. It is the percentage of common variance that can be explained by a single factor. An empirical example is given to demonstrate the main points of the paper.

Next, a similar invariance property is derived for the reliability of any set of components. Both generalizations are established by considering simultaneously optimal weights for components with maximum alpha and with maximum reliability, respectively. A short-cut formula is offered to evaluate the coefficients alpha for orthogonally rotated principal components from rotation weights and eigenvalues of the correlation matrix.

He provides important new insights into the authoritarian personality, revealing how aggression, fear, and reverence for authority are the ingredients that fuel right-wing authoritarian movements. He explores the effects that parents, religion, and early education can have on the development of authoritarian attitudes in young adults--and explains why some religions produce greater levels of authoritarianism in their members than others. He examines the connections between right-wing authoritarianism and political affiliations, exploring the question of whether authoritarianism exists on the Left. And he examines the nature of the authoritarian threat to Western society--and how the power of our educational systems, news media, and religious institutions can be positively harnessed to ensure individual freedoms.

Consistent with prior findings using twins, gay brothers were similar in their degree of childhood gender nonconformity, suggesting that this variable may distinguish etiologically (e.g., genetically) heterogeneous subtypes. The large majority of gay men with brothers knew about their own homosexual feelings before they learned about their brothers' homosexual feelings, suggesting that discovery of brothers' homosexuality is not an important cause of male homosexuality.

Key errors made included (1) the failure to take range restriction into account, (2) failure to take criterion unreliability into account, and (3) reanalysis.

Sherley (see record 2007-09994-003) on the original article (see record 2007-03168-001). Lerdau and Avery raise the important issue of the nature of the causal links between test scores and student performance. Clearly, scientists cannot directly manipulate GRE scores to conduct formal experiments. We must rely on a convergence of evidence to draw inferences about causality. We are in complete agreement with Brown that the "essence of a successful graduate program is the production of an able professional." However, we strongly disagree that the tests do not predict much more than grades. Our analytic methods are solid, and Sherley provides no evidence or citations to indicate otherwise. That Sherley can in one sentence argue that our methods do not yield an estimate of predictive power and in another argue that the estimate of predictive power is too, weak suggests that something is amiss with his argument and logic. This criticism is so puzzling, we wonder if Sherley believes that we present weighted correlations between means, which would be inappropriate, instead of the weighted mean of correlations that comprise our data.

Several meta-analyses have been conducted to extract more reliable conclusions about standardized tests from a variety of disciplines. We collected and synthesized these studies. The tests aim to measure the most relevant skills and knowledge for mastering a particular discipline. Research has been conducted on the correlation between test scores and various measures of student success: first-year grade point average (GPA), graduate GPA, degree attainment, qualifying or comprehensive examination scores, research productivity, research citation counts, licensing examination performance, and faculty evaluations of students. One concern is that admissions tests might be biased against certain groups, including racial, ethnic, and gender groups. However, student motivation and interest, which are critical for sustained effort though graduate education, must be inferred from various unstandardized measures including letters of recommendation, personal statements, and interviews. Additional research is needed to develop measures that provide more reliable information about these key characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Humans are highly social animals and often help unrelated individuals that may never reciprocate the altruist's favour. This apparent evolutionary puzzle may be explained by the altruist's gain in social image: image-scoring bystanders, also known as eavesdroppers, notice the altruistic act and therefore are more likely to help the altruist in the future. Such complex indirect reciprocity based on altruistic acts may evolve only after simple indirect reciprocity has been established, which requires two steps. First, image scoring evolves when bystanders gain personal benefits from information gathered, for example, by finding cooperative partners. Second, altruistic behaviour in the presence of such bystanders may evolve if altruists benefit from access to the bystanders. Here, we provide experimental evidence for both of the requirements in a cleaning mutualism involving the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. These cleaners may cooperate and remove ectoparasites from clients or they may cheat by feeding on client mucus. As mucus may be preferred over typical client ectoparasites, clients must make cleaners feed against their preference to obtain a cooperative service. We found that eavesdropping clients spent more tune next to 'cooperative' than 'unknown cooperative level' cleaners, which shows that clients engage in image-scoring behaviour. Furthermore, trained cleaners learned to feed more cooperatively when in an 'imagescoring' than in a 'non-image-scoring' situation.

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that individuals may prevent partners from cheating by building up relationships slowly, giving very little in the beginning and raising the stakes in subsequent moves if partners reciprocate. The author tested this idea with field experiments on the cleaner-fish, Labroides dimidiatus, and its "client" reef fish. Clients visit cleaners at their small territories, so-called cleaning stations, to have parasites removed. Cleaners were first observed and then caught and either put back on their original territory or moved to a new site. A variety of cleaner and client behaviours were noted to evaluate how, if at all, relationships are built up. Cleaners and resident clients indeed build up relationships, but with heavy initial investment. There was no evidence that cleaners build up relationships with client species that have access to several cleaners. Finally, it appeared that cleaners constantly invest in relationships with predatory clients, possibly to reduce the risk that predators try to catch them. It is proposed that asymmetries between partners with respect to either payoff values or strategic options are the major reason why the results do not fit the so-called raising-the-stakes strategy.

	Abstract = {How can cooperation persist if, for one partner, cheating is more profitable than cooperation in each round, while the other partner has no option to cheat? Our laboratory experiments suggest that such a situation exists between the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus and its nonpredatory client reef fish species, which actively seek cleaners to have their ectoparasites removed. Clients Ctenochaetus striatus regularly jolted in response to cleaner mouth contact, and these jolts were not linked to the removal of parasites. In addition, cleaners did not search for parasites but fed on mucus when exposed to anaesthetized clients, which could not control the cleaners' behavior. Field data showed that clients often terminated an interaction immediately after a jolt. Client species with access to only one cleaning station, owing to their small territories or home ranges, terminated interactions mainly by chasing cleaners while clients with access to two or more cleaning stations mainly swam away. The chasing of cleaners appeared to be a form of punishment, imposing costs on the cleaner at the client's expense. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Consistent with some previous studies, we found significant correlations among some of the Dark Triad variables and between each of the Dark Triad variables and some of the Big 5. To the extent that these variables were correlated at the phenotypic level, these correlations were largely attributable to correlated genetic factors. At the univariate level, all traits showed the influence of genetic and non-shared environmental factors, with heritabilities ranging between .31 and .72; Machiavellianism alone also showed the influence of shared environmental factors.

Although this domain of study has been extended to examine systematic differences in life history strategy among various human ethnic groupings, more recent evolutionary theories of human development and related behavioral genetic work imply substantial within-group individual variation in life history strategy. We constructed a latent variable model identifying a single common factor, denoted as K, which underlies a variety of otherwise disparate life history parameters. This "K-Factor" loaded 0.36 on childhood attachment to the biological father, -0.36 on childhood attachment to any non-biological father figure, 0.38 on adult romantic partner attachment, -0.51 on mating effort, -0.58 on Machiavellianism, and -0.41 on risk propensity. The bivariate correlations of the K-factor with higher-order personality factors were statistically significant, -0.24 with "Big Neuroticism" and -0.67 with "Big Psychoticism", and approached significance, correlating 0.12, with "Big Extraversion". The K-factor appears to be an underappreciated individual difference variable of major importance to human development.

In a sample of 245 students, the authors measured the three constructs with standard measures and examined a variety of laboratory and self-report correlates. The measures were moderately inter-correlated, but certainly were not equivalent. Their only common Big Five correlate was disagreeableness. Subclinical psychopaths were distinguished by low neuroticism; Machiavellians and psychopaths were low in conscientiousness; narcissism showed small positive associations with cognitive ability. Narcissists and, to a lesser extent, psychopaths exhibited self-enhancement on two objectively scored indexes.

The Mach-IV is used to predict the behavior of participants in a two-person one-shot constituent game in which subjects face a choice between trust and distrust, and between reciprocation (trustworthiness) and defection. It was found that the Mach-IV scale does not predict trusting behavior. It does, however, predict reciprocity. Over one half of those who score low to average on the scale reciprocate trust.

The defining elements of automatic and strategic processing are discussed with the cognitive bias in anxiety reconceptualized terms of a mixture of automatic and strategic processing characteristics depending on which stage of the information processing model is under consideration. The goal in the treatment of anxiety is to deactivate the more automatic primal threat mode and to strengthen more constructive reflective modes of thinking. Arguments are presented for the inclusion of verbal mediation as a necessary but not sufficient component in the cognitive and behavioral treatment of anxiety.

	Abstract = {Although it is well-established that vulnerability to negative emotion is associated with attentional bias toward aversive information, the causal basis of this association remains undetermined. Two studies addressed this issue by experimentally inducing differential attentional responses to emotional stimuli using a modified dot probe task, and then examining the impact of such attentional manipulation on subsequent emotional vulnerability. The results supported the hypothesis that the induction of attentional bias should serve to modify emotional vulnerability, as revealed by participants' emotional reactions to a final standardized stress task. These findings provide a sound empirical basis for the previously speculative proposal that attentional bias can causally mediate emotional vulnerability, and they suggest the possibility that cognitive-experimental procedures designed to modify selective information processing may have potential therapeutic value.

This modification has come to be called the emotional Stroop task because the response to the critical noncolor words, as in the suicide illustration just described, is seen as at least partly having to do with affect. Since the 1980s, there has been a rapidly increasing number of studies in clinical psychology in which this emotional Stroop task has been used to explore aspects of anxieties and clinical disorders.

Ray (see record 2007-08928-001) regarding the current author's book, Enemies of freedom: Understanding right wing authoritarianism (see record 1988-98419-000). The foremost of Ray's six criticisms is that "insofar as (I have) studied anything at all, (I have) probably studied some form of conservatism." The constructs of "right-wing authoritarianism" and "conservatism" can be defined as one wishes, and one can declare that they are the same thing. I prefer to draw several conceptual distinctions however, perhaps because one brand of "conservatism", especially visible in the United States, resents government authority. Next, Professor Ray quite correctly points out that my explanation of the development of personal authoritarianism ignored genetic possibilities. The twins-studies have caught me completely flat-footed, with my back turned, though I would find evidence for a DNA-based explanation of authoritarianism quite exciting. As for attitudes toward authorities, I suspect they do wobble some during adolescence. However, neither of the two adult studies Professor Ray cites shows "a general attitude toward authority does not exist." If anything, they suggest it does. Professor Ray says the consistency of the RWA Scale only occurs because my item selection procedures have created a distortion of the real world, a world of my own "from which the most disturbing outside information has been rigorously excluded." In fact, the covariation among items mentioning different kinds of authorities goes back to the Berkeley F Scale. Finally, Professor Ray concludes that I am studying some nonpolitical form of conservatism, because the RWA Scale gives "virtually no prediction of right-wing political preference." Data is presented to dispute this allegation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Latency data from the verification of true and false items indicated that individuals decompose figural patterns in a way that represents a sequential determination of the various elements that need to be isolated. They also appear to identify and evaluate the transformations applied to elements in a way that represents a sequential determination of the separate or successive transformations that fully specify an item rule. Analysis and evaluation of transformations took more time than element analysis and was the primary source of errors. The combined effects of element and transformation processing violated a simple additive model, and the best fitting functions suggest that nonadditive increases in solution latency and error rates were due to working memory limitations associated with the representation and manipulation of item features at high levels of rule complexity. Correlational data also indicated that these factors partially account for individual differences in performance on psychometric tests. The latency and error data for true and false items are used to develop a general theoretical system that incorporates assumptions about the form of item representation, working memory factors, and processing components and strategies in analogical reasoning tasks.

The best-performing measure incorporates data from the IAT's practice trials, uses a metric that is calibrated by each respondent's latency variability, and includes a latency penalty for errors. This new algorithm strongly outperforms the earlier (conventional) procedure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {As the Internet has changed communication, commerce, and the distribution of information, so too it is changing psychological research. Psychologists can observe new or rare phenomena online and can do research on traditional psychological topics more efficiently, enabling them to expand the scale and scope of their research. Yet these opportunities entail risk both to research quality and to human subjects. Internet research is inherently no more risky than traditional observational, survey, or experimental methods. Yet the risks and safeguards against them will differ from those characterizing traditional research and will themselves change over time. This article describes some benefits and challenges of conducting psychological research via the Internet and offers recommendations to both researchers and institutional review boards for dealing with them.

Primary attention is focused on a task in which 75 students from 8 countries, but all studying at a university in the United States, gave pairwise ratings of overall similarity with respect to a set of 21 nations. An INDSCAL analysis, a multidimensional scaling procedure developed by J. D. Carroll and J. J. Chang, of the similarities data revealed 4 dimensions which were interpreted as: political alignment and ideology, economic development, geography and population, and culture and race. Economic development was more important than political alignment to doves, males, and Ss from developed countries, whereas the opposite was true for nondoves, females, and Ss from underdeveloped countries. Differences in the Ss' conceptions of nations appeared to be of degree rather than kind. (32 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Specific examples of three kinds of Web-based research are reviewed: (a) translational (established methods and research questions are adapted to the Web), (b) phenomenological (behavior on the Web is the focus of study), and (c) novel (methodologically innovations unique to Web-based research). Among other findings, our review indicated that 21% of APA journals published at least one article that reported on Web-based research, most Web-based psychological research uses experimental methods, a surprising number use college student samples, and deception in Web-based research is not uncommon. Strengths and weaknesses of Web-based psychological research in general, and our sample of studies in particular, are reviewed with special attention to possible concerns about sampling and the use of deception.

Internet data collection methods, with a focus on self-report questionnaires from self-selected samples, are evaluated and compared with traditional paper-and-pencil methods. Six preconceptions about Internet samples and data quality are evaluated by comparing a new large Internet sample (N = 361,703) with a set of 510 published traditional samples. Internet samples are shown to be relatively diverse with respect to gender, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and age. Moreover, Internet findings generalize across presentation formats, are not adversely affected by nonserious or repeat responders, and are consistent with findings from traditional methods. It is concluded that Internet methods can contribute to many areas of psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

We report two studies, the first showing the psychometric properties of a new trust inventory (the Propensity to Trust Survey or PTS), the second study validating this inventory using the standard economic task, the Investment Game. The first study utilized online survey data (N > 8000) to show that the PTS scales were reliable and measured broad constructs related to Big Five personality domains. Trust was related to extraversion and negative neuroticism, and trustworthiness was related to agreeableness and conscientiousness. The second study (N = 90) validated the PTS trust scale as a predictor of behavior in the Investment Game. These findings are evidence that trust and trustworthiness are compound personality traits, and that PTS scales are preferable to general Big Five measures for predicting trusting behavior.},

We construct examples of national and regional rankings, using hand-collected data on 3,240 high- achieving students. Our statistical model extends models used for ranking players in tournaments, such as chess or tennis. When a student makes his matriculation decision among colleges that have admitted him, he chooses which college "wins" in head-to-head competition. The model exploits the information contained in thousands of these wins and losses. Our method produces a ranking that would be difficult for a college to manipulate. In contrast, it is easy to manipulate the matriculation rate and the admission rate, which are the common measures of preference that receive substantial weight in highly publicized college rating systems. If our ranking were used in place of these measures, the pressure on colleges to practice strategic admissions would be relieved.},

@incollection{Sloman:05,
	Abstract = {(from the chapter) Much discussion of emotions and related topics is riddled with confusion because different authors use the key expressions with different meanings. Some confuse the concept of "emotion" with the more general concept of "affect," which covers other things besides emotions, including moods, attitudes, desires, preferences, intentions, dislikes, etc. Moreover, researchers have different goals: some are concerned with understanding natural phenomena, while others are more concerned with producing useful artifacts, e.g., synthetic entertainment agents, sympathetic machine interfaces, and the like. We address this confusion by showing how "architecture-based" concepts can extend and refine our folk-psychology concepts in ways that make them more useful both for expressing scientific questions and theories, and for specifying engineering objectives. An implication is that different information-processing architectures support different classes of emotions, different classes of consciousness, different varieties of perception, and so on. We start with high-level concepts applicable to a wide variety of natural and artificial systems, including very simple organisms--namely, concepts such as "need," "function," "information-user," "affect," and "information-processing architecture." For more complex architectures, we offer the CogAff schema as a generic framework that distinguishes types of components that may be in an architecture, operating concurrently with different functional roles. We also sketch H-CogAff, a richly featured special case of CogAff, conjectured as a type of architecture that can explain or replicate human mental phenomena. We show how the concepts that are definable in terms of such architectures can clarify and enrich research on human emotions. If successful for the purposes of science and philosophy, the architecture is also likely to be useful for engineering purposes, though many engineering goals can be achieved using shallow concepts and shallow theories, e.g., producing "believable" agents for computer entertainments. The more human-like robot emotions will emerge, as they do in humans, from the interactions of many mechanisms serving different purposes, not from a particular, dedicated "emotion mechanism."

	Abstract = {Proposes that the construing of situations by an individual as similar leads to consistency in responses to those situations and that, obversely, perceiving situations as dissimilar leads to inconsistency in responding. An interactional approach to the issue of transsituational consistency, which relates persons and situations via the mediating variable of a person's world view, is suggested. A model for the mediating variable is proposed that emphasizes the idiographic distortions of a shared nomothetic structure of the world. This model was tested using individual differences multidimensional scaling (INDSCAL) to recreate 100 individuals' judgments of similarity between 28 pairs of social situations. These INDSCAL-derived similarities (which conform to the model of the proposed mediating cognitive structure) significantly predicted variability across the situations for 58% of the Ss. The most predictable 50 Ss had an average correlation of .38 between the INDSCAL-recreated similarities and their self-reported transsituational variability. The least-predictable 50 Ss had an average correlation of only .09. The degree of fit of the INDSCAL model to the initial data was significantly related to how well a particular S's variability scores could be predicted from the INDSCAL model. The advantages of the proposed idiographic/nomothetic model over a purely idiographic model are discussed.},

However, an auxiliary representation, in which the descriptive and evaluative aspects are clearly separated, has technological utility in some areas of research and assessment. D. Peabody (1968, 1985) and H. G. Gough (1987) independently developed structural models of this type, each with 3 dimensions. Studies used a multiple-method, multiple-replication approach, with data sets involving a large, representative set of familiar personality adjectives, to uncover a structure with 5 orthogonal dimensions, 4 descriptive and 1 highly evaluative, easily measurable with adjective scales. These dimensions demonstrated a complex relation to previous Peabody factors and to the Big Five, and they may be useful in integrating some venerable constructs into the structure of personality attributes.

Study 1 showed that 2 similar descriptive factors can be found in analyses of personality terms, selected independently in 316 English Ss and in 362 German Ss and using different methods to control for evaluation. The factors relate to 2 pairs of independent axes suggested by previous work: Assertive-Unassertive and Tight-Loose, or alternatively, Interactional Orientation (Extraversion-Introversion) and Affective Orientation. These 2 pairs of axes are shown to be rotations of each other, and to form the prime non-evaluative circumplex. As in previous studies, non-evaluative scales elicited higher levels of self-peer agreement than did more typical evaluation-confounded scales. Study 2 showed that adjective scales for the octants of this circumplex have circular ordering, can fit even very stringent constraints of a circumplex model, have mild to strong isomorphism with the interpersonal circumplex, but represent somewhat broader constructs, and are systematically related to the Big 5 and the Big 3 personality factors.

However, although the Big Five factors are held to be orthogonal, they are not orthogonal in previous marker set developed for them. The author describes methods for creating relatively orthogonal marker sets for orthogonal factors and demonstrates that the Big Five can be operationalized in relatively orthogonal marker scales. The three marker sets present are a 40-itern short form of Goldberg's 100 unipolar markers (Ortho-Markers), a new set of Modular Markers built with item parcels, and a 40-item short form of these (Mini-Modular Markers [the 3M40]). The new Big Five marker sets are shown to have markedly lower interscale correlations, with no loss of validity, relative to previous marker sets with comparable numbers of items. This indicates that the nonorthogonality of previous Big Five marker scales is less a property of the Big Five model than an unintended outcome of commonly used scale construction procedures.

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) A factor is a parsimonious reduction of many observed variables into one hypothetical variable, accomplished within a particular set of data. The Big Five personality factor structure involves five orthogonal factors that capture the five largest sources of variance shared by the variables in fairly representative assemblages of personality-attribute descriptors in a number of languages. Whether the Big Five is the optimal cross-culturally generalizable taxonomic structure for human personality is still a matter of controversy, but it is clearly a very useful structure. This chapter describes various marker sets developed by the authors for the Big Five and related structures. We present these marker sets within a broader conceptual framework, reviewing 10 diverse psychometric criteria by which marker sets can be developed and evaluated. Because constructing a set of factor markers is typically an item-reduction exercise, we focus on the item selection process. The principles and issues we discuss are important to personality-test construction in general, in most cases applying also to scales that are not factor-analytically derived as are Big Five scales.

Pairings of 3 factors (I, II, and IV) showed a markedly large incidence of interstitial variables. These 3 factors, referencing affective and interpersonal traits, formed a 3-dimensional space. Adjective clusters defining both factor-univocal and interstitial benchmark positions in this space were developed.

The advantages and disadvantages of this approach relative to more traditional statistical approaches are discussed. The conclusion is that the covariance structure modeling approach has significant advantages in that it provides a closer conceptual match to the theoretical assumptions of circumplex representations, supplies information more directly relevant to circumplex representations and permits more precise and flexible testing of hypotheses derived from circumplex representations.

Such a causal account relies on a realist ontology in which manifest diagnoses are only a means to learning about the latent distribution, whether categorical or dimensional. Comorbidity of DSM diagnoses suggests that dimensionality will be the rule, not the exception, with internalization and externalization describing common diagnoses.

A conceptual and psychometric framework is described for distinguishing whether the latent structure behind manifest categories (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, attitude groups, or stages of development) is category-like or dimension-like. Being dimension-like requires (a) within-category heterogeneity and (b) between-category quantitative differences. Being category-like requires (a) within-category homogeneity and (b) between-category qualitative differences. The relation between this classification and abrupt versus smooth differences is discussed. Hybrid structures are possible. Being category-like is itself a matter of degree; the authors offer a formalized framework to determine this degree.

Anderson's model is intended for correlation matrices with positive elements. A replacement for Anderson's correlation function that permits negative correlations is suggested. The resulting model may be reparametrized as a factor analysis model with nonlinear constraints on the factor loadings. An unrestricted factor analysis, followed by an appropriate rotation, is employed to obtain parameter estimates.

The broad coverage is based on the belief that there are many valid approaches and a rich diversity of techniques for studying motivational and emotional phenomena, and that the understanding of human motivation and emotion requires consideration of these points of view and methodologies. /// This book applies an encompassing developmental-interactionist view to the classic trilogy of psychology--motivation, emotion, and cognition, sometimes called the Big MEC. The developmental-interactionist perspective seeks to arrange and coordinate existing theory and data, showing how a theory often accounts successfully for a limited range or level of motivational and emotional phenomena but is not relevant to phenomena outside this range or level. Theories that seem to conflict with one another are often not directly relevant to one another, for they are focused on different phenomena. Developmental-interactionist theory attempts to organize these diverse points of view, giving a general picture that incorporates data literally from the beginning of life on the earth in the DNA molecule to the changes music television may be causing in social organization (Marshall McLuhan's "global village") through global emotional communication.

form is more apparent than real. Generally speaking, a mere 
tendency of two characteristics to vary concurrently must be 
taken, it seems to me, as the effect of some particular underly- 
ing strict law (or laws) partly neutralized by a multitude of 
'casual' disturbing influences. The quantity of a correlation 
is neither more nor less than the relative influence of the un-
derlying law in question as compared with the total of all the 
influences in play. Now, it may easily happen, that the under- 
lying law is one of simple proportionality but the disturbing 
influences become greater when the correlated characteristics 
are larger (or smaller, as the case may be). Then the underly- 
ing simple proportionality will not appear on the surface; the 
correlation will seem non-linear. Under such circumstances, 
r cannot, it is true, express these variations in the quantity of 
correlation; it continues, however, to express completely the 
mean quantity of correlation. 
In the majority of the remaining cases of non-linearity, the 
latter is merely due to a wrong choice of the correlated terms. 
For instance, the correlation between the length of the skull 
and the weight of the brain must, obviously, be very far from 
linear. But linearity is at once restored (supposing all the 
skulls to belong to one type) if we change the second term 
from the brain's weight to the cube root ofthe weight. 
To conclude, even when the underlying law itself really has a 
special non-linear form, although r by itself reveals nothing of 
this form, it nevertheless still gives (except in a few extreme 
and readily noticeable cases) a fairly approximate measure of 
the correlation's quantity.'   p 168-169

Several examples of such primary parts were reviewed, including the trilogy-of-mind set, the topographic set, the lateral-brain set, and the systems set. The particular case of the id, ego, and superego was examined and some general recommendations were made about revising the set. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {For more than half a century, emotion researchers have attempted to establish the dimensional space that most economically accounts for similarities and differences in emotional experience. Today, many researchers focus exclusively on two-dimensional models involving valence and arousal. Adopting a theoretically based approach, we show for three languages that four dimensions are needed to satisfactorily represent similarities and differences in the meaning of emotion words. In order of importance, these dimensions are evaluation-pleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. They were identified on the basis of the applicability of 144 features representing the six components of emotions: (a) appraisals of events, (b) psycho-physiological changes, (c) motor expressions, (d) action tendencies, (e) subjective experiences, and (f) emotion regulation.

	Abstract = {Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love was examined to identify the structure of the psyche implied in that theory. Sternberg's theory posits three components of human functioning to explain the phenomenon of love in close relationships: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Analysis of these three components indicates that they align with a neoclassical model of the human psyche. A neoclassical psyche consists of at least three fundamental, irreducible capacities: cognition, affect, and conation. Sternberg's commitment component relies on the capacity for cognition (and conation), the passion component is derived from conation (and affect), and the intimacy component is derived from emotional investment or the capacity for affect (and cognition). Therefore, Sternberg's overall Triangular Theory of Love ontologically presupposes a neoclassical structure to the psyche.

A new classification is proposed that uses three sets of crosscutting variables: instrumental, affective, and cognitive; social versus nonsocial; and self versus nonself. The resulting table reveals which traits are most frequently studied and which need more attention. The patterning of traits that show sex differences suggests their origin. Adult traits are classified as well as those occurring in childhood and infancy, and implications are drawn for personality development. In addition to content traits, stylistic traits are classified. Compared to extant organizations of traits, this one is more detailed and more closely linked to variables outside the classification.

Group-level results indicate that performance was an interactive function of task, caffeine, and impulsivity. As predicted by the Yerkes-Dodson law, performance on the easy task tended to improve as caffeine dosage increased, but on the difficult task, (less aroused) impulsive Ss improved while (more aroused) nonimpulsive Ss improved then deteriorated.

Neiss (see record 1989-14248-001) concluded that both the construct of arousal and the hypothesis of an inverted-U relationship between performance and arousal should be abandoned. These arguments were, however, based on research that does not permit clear evaluation of either the construct of arousal or the inverted-U hypothesis. Furthermore, some of Neiss's assumptions are questionable. This article reviews evidence that provides strong support for the inverted-U hypothesis.

	Abstract = {A major problem with Implicit Association Tests (IATs) is that they require bipolar attributes (e.g., good-bad). Thus, IAT effects for an attribute category can be interpreted only relative to an opposite category. Problems arise if there is no clear opposite category; in this case, a neutral category can be used, although it induces systematic error variance and thus reduces validity. The present study suggests that this problem can be solved using single-attribute IATs (SA-IATs). Sociosexuality (the tendency to engage in uncommitted sex) was expected to be related at the implicit level to stronger stranger-sex associations relative to partner-sex associations. An IAT was constructed that used conversation as a neutral attribute; it showed satisfactory reliability but only low correlations with explicit sociosexuality. An alternative SA-IAT with sex as the only attribute showed a similar reliability but higher correlations with explicit sociosexuality.

However, reported preferences need not correspond to actual mate choices, which are more relevant from an evolutionary perspective. In a study of 46 adults participating in a speed-dating event, we were largely able to replicate Buston and Emlen's self-report results in a pre-event questionnaire, but we found that the stated preferences did not predict actual choices made during the speed-dates. Instead, men chose women based on their physical attractiveness, whereas women, who were generally much more discriminating than men, chose men whose overall desirability as a mate matched the women's self-perceived physical attractiveness. Unlike the cognitive processes that Buston and Emlen inferred from self-reports, this pattern of results from actual mate choices is very much in line with the evolutionary predictions of parental investment theory.

	Abstract = {Genetic influences on personality differences are ubiquitous, but their nature is not well understood. A theoretical framework might help, and can be provided by evolutionary genetics. We assess three evolutionary genetic mechanisms that could explain genetic variance in personality differences: selective neutrality, mutation-selection balance, and balancing selection. Based on evolutionary genetic theory and empirical results from behaviour genetics and personality psychology, we conclude that selective neutrality is largely irrelevant, that mutation-selection balance seems best at explaining genetic variance in intelligence, and that balancing selection by environmental heterogeneity seems best at explaining genetic variance in personality traits. We propose a general model of heritable personality differences that conceptualises intelligence as fitness components and personality traits as individual reaction norms of genotypes across environments, with different fitness consequences in different environmental niches. We also discuss the place of mental health in the model. This evolutionary genetic framework highlights the role of gene-environment interactions in the study of personality, yields new insight into the person-situation-debate and the structure of personality, and has practical implications for both quantitative and molecular genetic studies of personality.

	Abstract = {Most theories of human mental evolution assume that selection favored higher intelligence and larger brains, which should have reduced genetic variance in both. However, adult human intelligence remains highly heritable, and is genetically correlated with brain size. This conflict might be resolved by estimating the coefficient of additive genetic variance (CVA) in human brain size, since CVAs are widely used in evolutionary genetics as indexes of recent selection. Here we calculate for the first time that this CVA is about 7.8, based on data from 19 recent MRI studies of adult human brain size in vivo: 11 studies on brain size means and standard deviations, and 8 studies on brain size heritabilities. This CVA appears lower than that for any other human organ volume or life-history trait, suggesting that the brain has been under strong stabilizing (average-is-better) selection. This result is hard to reconcile with most current theories of human mental evolution, which emphasize directional (more-is-better) selection for higher intelligence and larger brains. Either these theories are all wrong, or CVAs are not as evolutionarily informative as most evolutionary geneticists believe, or, as we suggest, brain size is not a very good index for understanding the evolutionary genetics of human intelligence.

Fifty British male participants were assigned to two groups (restricted versus unrestricted) based on their responses to items on the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory. Participants rated the attractiveness, health and fertility of a series of 50 photographs of women varying in body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Results suggested that both groups of men based their judgements primarily on BMI rather than WHR. However, there were significant between-groups differences: unrestricted men judged women with a lower BMI as more attractive, healthy and fertile than restricted men. Unrestricted men also showed a stronger preference for women with a low WHR. The results support a dynamic psychological model of interpersonal attraction, which many earlier studies have neglected.

	Abstract = {A major problem with Implicit Association Tests (IATs) is that they require bipolar attributes (e.g., good-bad). Thus, IAT effects for an attribute category can be interpreted only relative to an opposite category. Problems arise if there is no clear opposite category; in this case, a neutral category can be used, although it induces systematic error variance and thus reduces validity. The present study suggests that this problem can be solved using single-attribute IATs (SA-IATs). Sociosexuality (the tendency to engage in uncommitted sex) was expected to be related at the implicit level to stronger stranger-sex associations relative to partner-sex associations. An IAT was constructed that used conversation as a neutral attribute; it showed satisfactory reliability but only low correlations with explicit sociosexuality. An alternative SA-IAT with sex as the only attribute showed a similar reliability but higher correlations with explicit sociosexuality.

In response, we clarify the scientific status of evolutionary genetic theory and explain the plausibility and value of our evolutionary genetic model of personality, despite some shortcomings with the currently available theories and data. We also have a closer look at mate choice for personality traits, point to promising ways to assess evolutionarily relevant environmental factors and defend higher-order personality domains and the g-factor as the best units for evolutionary genetic analyses. Finally, we discuss which extensions of and alternatives to our model appear most fruitful, and end with a call for more inter-disciplinary personality research grounded in evolutionary theory.

	Abstract = {Genetic influences on personality differences are ubiquitous, but their nature is not well understood. A theoretical framework might help, and can be provided by evolutionary genetics. We assess three evolutionary genetic mechanisms that could explain genetic variance in personality differences: selective neutrality, mutation-selection balance, and balancing selection. Based on evolutionary genetic theory and empirical results from behaviour genetics and personality psychology, we conclude that selective neutrality is largely irrelevant, that mutation-selection balance seems best at explaining genetic variance in intelligence, and that balancing selection by environmental heterogeneity seems best at explaining genetic variance in personality traits. We propose a general model of heritable personality differences that conceptualises intelligence as fitness components and personality traits as individual reaction norms of genotypes across environments, with different fitness consequences in different environmental niches. We also discuss the place of mental health in the model. This evolutionary genetic framework highlights the role of gene-environment interactions in the study of personality, yields new insight into the person-situation-debate and the structure of personality, and has practical implications for both quantitative and molecular genetic studies of personality.

	Abstract = {Most theories of human mental evolution assume that selection favored higher intelligence and larger brains, which should have reduced genetic variance in both. However, adult human intelligence remains highly heritable, and is genetically correlated with brain size. This conflict might be resolved by estimating the coefficient of additive genetic variance (CVA) in human brain size, since CVAs are widely used in evolutionary genetics as indexes of recent selection. Here we calculate for the first time that this CVA is about 7.8, based on data from 19 recent MRI studies of adult human brain size in vivo: 11 studies on brain size means and standard deviations, and 8 studies on brain size heritabilities. This CVA appears lower than that for any other human organ volume or life-history trait, suggesting that the brain has been under strong stabilizing (average-is-better) selection. This result is hard to reconcile with most current theories of human mental evolution, which emphasize directional (more-is-better) selection for higher intelligence and larger brains. Either these theories are all wrong, or CVAs are not as evolutionarily informative as most evolutionary geneticists believe, or, as we suggest, brain size is not a very good index for understanding the evolutionary genetics of human intelligence.

	Abstract = {The research described in this article estimated the relative incidence of protocols invalidated by linguistic incompetence, inattentiveness, and intentional misrepresentation in Web-based versus paper-and-pencil personality measures. Estimates of protocol invalidity were derived from a sample of 23,994 protocols produced by individuals who completed an online version of the 300-item IPIP representation of the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg, 1999). Approximately 3.8% of the protocols were judged to be products of repeat participants, many of whom apparently resubmitted after changing some of their answers. Among non-duplicate protocols, about 3.5% came from individuals who apparently selected a response option repeatedly without reading the item, compared to .9% in a sample of paper-and-pencil protocols. The missing response rate was 1.2%, which is 2-10 times higher than the rate found in several samples of paper-and-pencil inventories of comparable length. Two measures of response consistency indicated that perhaps 1% of the protocols were invalid due to linguistic incompetence or inattentive responding, but that Web participants were as consistent as individuals responding to a paper-and-pencil inventory. Inconsistency did not affect factorial structure and was found to be related positively to neuroticism and negatively to openness to experience. Intentional misrepresentation was not studied directly, but arguments for a low incidence of misrepresentation are presented. Methods for preventing, detecting, and handling invalid response patterns are discussed. Suggested for future research are studies that assess the moderating effects of linguistic incompetence, inattentiveness, and intentional misrepresentation on agreement between self-report and acquaintance judgments about personality.

	Abstract = {Summated scales are widely used in management research to measure constructs such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment. This article suggests that Revelle's (1979) coefficient beta, implemented in Revelle's (1978) ICLUST item-clustering procedure, should be used in conjunction with Cronbach's coefficient alpha measure of internal consistency as criteria for judging the dimensionality and internal homogeneity of summated scales. The approach is demonstrated using ICLUST reanalyses of sample responses to Warr's (1990) affective well-being scale and O'Brien, Dowling, and Kabanoff's (1978) job satisfaction scale. Coefficient beta and item clustering are shown to more clearly identify the homogeneity and internal dimensional structure of summated scale constructs than do traditional principal components analyses. Given these benefits, Revelle's approach is a viable alternative methodology for scale construction in management, organizational, and cross-cultural contexts, especially when researchers need to make defensible choices between using whole scales or subscales.},

	Abstract = {Three recent studies have used twin data to explore the possibility of differential contributions of heritability and environmentality to individual differences in cognitive ability as a function of ability level (Detterman, D. K., et al., Behav. Genet. 20:369-384; 1990; Bailey, M. J. amd Revelle, W., Behav. Genet. 21:397-404, 1991; Cherny, S. S., et al., Behav. Genet. 22:153-162, 1992). All arrived at different conclusions: higher heritability at the low end, higher heritability at the high end, and no differential influence, respectively. The current report involves a sample of 148 identical and 135 fraternal twin pairs from the Western Twin Project who were tested on a battery of intelligence and achievement tests to further explore the issue. The results suggest no significant differences in heritability at either the high or the low end, although a trend toward higher heritability for children of higher ability is evident. Individual differences for a composite ability/achievement score showed significantly greater influence of shared family environment at the low end than the rest of the distribution. In general, results for cognitive ability and academic achievement were highly similar.},

Humphreys and Revelle's theory claims that, as a function of increasing arousal, the amount of sustained information transfer (SIT) resources increases and the amound of short-term memory (STM) resources decreases. Performance on a SIT-decision task and a STM-decision task was examined under an exercise and control (minimal load) protocol Results indicated that physical exercise positively affected decision time in the SIT-task; this finding is consistent with the Humphreys and Revelle claim that high arousal induced by physical exercise increases the amount of SIT resources No evidence was found for the negative relationship between arousal and STM resources. A possible explanation for this latter finding was discussed in terms of a speed-accuracy tradeoff phenomenon.},

Theories of anxiety and performance need to address at least two major issues: (1) the complexity and apparent inconsistency of the findings; and (2) the conceptual definition of task difficulty. Some theorists (e.g. Humphreys \& Revelle, 1984; Sarason, 1988) argue that anxiety causes worry, and worry always impairs performance on tasks with high attentional or short-term memory demands. According to the processing efficiency theory, worry has two main effects: (1) a reduction in the storage and processing capacity of the working memory system available for a concurrent task; and (2) an increment in on-task effort and activities designed to improve performance. There is a crucial distinction within the theory between performance effectiveness (= quality of performance) and processing efficiency (= performance effectiveness divided by effort). Anxiety characteristically impairs efficiency more than effectiveness.},

	Abstract = {Two theoretical models were used to investigate aspects of basketball performance: Eysenck's (1979, 1984) compensatory arousal model and Humphreys and Revelle's (1984) twin resources model. Cognitive and somatic anxiety were manipulated using a 'time to event' paradigm. The aspects of performance were a short-term memory task (letter span) and a low memory demand, motoric-sustained information transfer task (rebound shooting). Hypotheses based on the different models were formulated and subsequently tested using analysis of variance and polynomial regression analysis. The results indicated significant (P < 0.01) linear relationships with negative slopes between cognitive anxiety and letter span, and between somatic anxiety and letter span; while significant (P < 0.01) linear relationships with positive slopes were recorded between cognitive anxiety and rebound shooting, and between somatic anxiety and rebound shooting. The analysis of variance results were in agreement with a positive effect (P < 0.05) for cognitive anxiety upon rebound shooting, and a negative effect which approached significance (P < 0.07) for somatic anxiety upon letter span. The results were interpreted as offering partial support for Eysenck's (1979) theoretical model, although further examination of multidimensional anxiety effects via the two models is warranted.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that the trait of extraversion is associated with physiological arousal (Eysenck, 1967). Both psychophysiological and behavioral studies have generally supported this statement (Eysenck \& Eysenck, 1985), However, recent research has suggested that the trait of impulsivity is the trait most closely linked to the physiological arousal mechanisms believed to underlie extraversion (Revelle, Humphreys, Simon, \& Gilliland, 1980). This study utilized brainstem auditory evoked responses (ABRs) to investigate which trait (extraversion, impulsivity, sociability) is most closely related to hypothesized ascending reticular activating system-regulated arousal processes. The results indicated that the full scale of extraversion was related to ABR wave V activity, r = .27, p < .025, with extraverts exhibiting slower ABR latencies compared to introverts. Analyses of the subscales indicated that sociability (r = .27, p < .025), rather than impulsivity (r = .05, p < .70), contributed more to this effect. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

	Abstract = {This article describes a model for response times that is proposed as a supplement to the usual factor-analytic model for responses to graded or more continuous typical-response items. The use of the proposed model together with the factor model provides additional information about the respondent and can potentially increase the accuracy of the individual trait estimates. First, the rationale of the model is discussed in relation to previous developments in binary responses. Second, procedures for fitting the model and for assessing model-data fit at both overall and individual level (person-fit) are proposed. Third, the usefulness of the model and its potential applications in the typical-response domain are discussed. All the proposed developments are used in 2 empirical applications in the personality domain. The first application analyzes 2 scales from a Big Five questionnaire. The second example analyzes a sociability scale developed from Eysenck's questionnaires.},

Extraverts were significantly more accurate in interpreting the meaning of nonverbal communication than introverts; extraverts were also more confident that they were accurate decoders than introverts. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing style: The extravert advantage in decoding nonverbal communication may be due to extraverts' superior attentive/perceptual skills; their superior interpretive/attributional skills; or both.

Consistent with the work of C. M. Patterson and J. P. Newman (1993), the BAS-mediated mechanism was related to a lack of inhibition in reward-directed behavior after introducing an occasional aversive contingency and to deficits in learning from aversive cues when responding for reward (Experiments 1-3). The BIS-mediated mechanism was related to a higher ability to extinguish aversive associations (Experiment 1), a lower aversive generalization gradient (Experiment 3), and a lower interference with appetitive behavior in the presence of aversive stimuli (Experiment 4).

In response, many have proposed alternative approaches for the assessment of personality psychopathology, including the application of the Five-Factor Model of personality (FFM). Many remain skeptical, however, as to whether domain and facet traits from a model of general personality functioning can be successfully applied to clinical patients with personality disorders (PDs). In this study, with a sample of psychiatric patients (n = 115), personality disorder symptoms corresponding to each of the 10 PDs were successfully predicted by the facet and domain traits of the FFM, as measured by a semi-structured interview, the Structured Interview for the Five Factor Model (SIFFM; Trull & Widiger, 1997) and a self-report questionnaire, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R; Costa and McCrae, 1992). These results provide support for the perspective that personality psychopathology can be captured by general personality dimensions. The FFM has the potential to provide a valid and scientifically sound framework from which to assess personality psychopathology, in a way that covers most of the domains conceptualized in DSM while transcending the limitations of the current categorical approach to these disorders.

These predictions were tested in two experiments using measures of Event-Related Potentials (ERP) as cortical indicators of differential responses to stimuli of varied emotional valence. In Experiment 1, positive, neutral and negative adjectives were used as conditioned stimuli of reward and punishment. Subjects were involved in a processing task in which attention was either attracted to or drawn away from the emotionality of the stimulus material. An interaction of extraversion, emotional valence of stimuli and processing task was found, but did not meet the predictions. In Experiment 2, a startle probe paradigm was used. Foreground stimulation consisted of emotionally positive, neutral and negative slides. Again, extraverts exhibited higher ERP amplitudes to emotionally positive and negative stimuli compared to neutral ones, whereas introverts did not show a differential effect to the emotional content of the stimuli. Thus, Gray's theory could not be confirmed in either one of the experiments... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Factor structures from the self- and peer-ratings on the Spanish version of the Big Seven questionnaire largely replicated the American structure (Waller, in press). Nevertheless, some psychologically meaningful item-level differences emerged... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

The "discovery" of the five factors may be influenced by unrecognized constraints on the variable sets analyzed. Lexical analyses are based on questionable conceptual and methodological assumptions, and have achieved uncertain results. The questionnaire version of the FFA has not demonstrated the special merits and sufficiencies of the five factors settled upon.

In the no-task condition, introverts were generally more reactive than extraverts. When attention was directed to the startle-eliciting stimulus, startle response amplitude was potentiated in both introverts and extraverts. When attention was directed to a visual task, acoustic startle reactivity was reduced for introverts, but not for extraverts. Therefore, introverts were more able to focus their attention, and were less distractible than extraverts. These data support previous findings of a narrower focus of attention in introverts than in extraverts, based on differences in arousal as a function of extraversion.

Across tasks, self-monitoring was associated with effective emotional performance. High self-monitors reported less stress and more deep acting than low self-monitors and did not experience elevated heart rate during emotional performance. The authors also examined affective traits, positing that emotional regulation would be less stressful for individuals who were asked to perform personality congruent emotions. As expected, individuals high on extraversion experienced elevated heart rates when asked to express personality incongruent emotions (i.e., anger). However, the association between extraversion and emotional performance was not significantly different for the two types of emotional regulation (anger and enthusiasm). Neuroticism was associated with increased heart rate and poor performance in both tasks. Overall, these data provide partial support for our personality congruency hypotheses and suggest that personality plays an important role in effective emotional performance.

Debate arose based on the fact that the MZT and DZT pairs were raised in the same environment, and that MZT pairs received more similar environmental treatment than did DZT pairs. This prompted a study of MZT and DZT pairs reared apart. Results indicated that the early studies of twin pairs only slightly overestimated the degree of genetic influence on personality variation; shared environmental influences appear to be quite small.

Much remains to be understood about how and why this is the case. We argue that placing the behavior genetics of personality in the context of epidemiology, evolutionary psychology, and neighboring psychological domains such as interests and attitudes should help lead to new insights. We suggest that important methodological advances, such as measuring traits from multiple viewpoints, using large samples, and analyzing data by modern multivariate techniques, have already led to major changes in our view of such perennial puzzles as the role of "unshared environment" in personality. In the long run, but not yet, approaches via molecular genetics and brain physiology may also make decisive contributions to understanding the heritability of personality traits. We conclude that the behavior genetics of personality is alive and flourishing but that there remains ample scope for new growth and that much social science research is seriously compromised if it does not incorporate genetic variation in its explanatory models.

Contrasts between the ES and IN groups revealed a number of significant differences in the auditory modality but no significant differences in the visual modality. In accord with prediction, the IN group exhibited steeper auditory P1N1 and N1P2 amplitude intensity functions than the ES group, and the IN group exhibited higher overall auditory P1N1 and N1P2 amplitudes, however, only the P1N1 difference was significant.

The 2nd study examined the relationship between a preschool actometer index and independently derived personality variables at ages 3, 4, and 7. Preschool AL related substantially to a set of interpersonal attributes as well as to an expected set of motoric attributes. A core set of these AL relationships was found at all 3 ages.

	Abstract = {This review outlines how functional brain imaging, using an individual-differences approach in the processing of emotional stimuli, has begun to reveal the neural basis of extraversion (E) and neuroticism (N), two traits that are linked to both emotion and health. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that individual differences in participants' E and N scores are correlated with individual differences in brain activation in specific brain regions that are engaged during cognitive-affective tasks. Imaging studies using genotyped participants have begun to address the molecular mechanisms that may underlie these individual differences. The multidisciplinary integration of brain imaging and molecular genetic methods offers an exciting and novel approach for investigators who seek to uncover the biological mechanisms by which personality and health are interrelated.

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) The focus on individual differences in complex behaviors is familiar to geneticists and personality psychologists, but less so to cognitive neuroscientists, who have traditionally regarded individual differences in their data sets as unwanted statistical noise (Plomin & Kosslyn, 2001). In neuroimaging of cognitive processes, individual differences may reduce statistical reliability. For example, if in a sample of 10 participants 5 showed activation in a certain brain region and 5 did not, what could we conclude? In the absence of any additional information, we would probably have to settle for stating that this region is not reliably activated. But how would the interpretation of the data change if additional information were available? For example, what if the 5 activators all happened to be female, and the 5 nonactivators all happened to be male? In this case, the inclusion of a specific dimension of individual differences (in this case, the sex of the participants) could reveal something about the brain's function ("Women activate, men don't") that otherwise would have been missed. A focus on individual differences in neuroimaging is a relatively recent phenomenon. One of the earliest references comes from a neuroimaging study of language (Steinmetz \& Seitz, 1991), in which the authors drew attention to individual differences in the localization of language. Since then, the publication record has steadily grown: A database search (MEDLINE) of the terms "individual difference" and either "PET" or "fMRI" returned 5 publications from 1990-1994, 11 from 1995-1999, and 57 from 2000-2004.

	Abstract = {Neuroticism and extraversion are personality traits associated with negative and positive mood states, respectively, confounding trait and state factors that may affect brain responses to emotional stimuli. The authors dissociated these factors using fMRI and the emotional Stroop attention task: Anterior cingulate (AC) response to positive stimuli varied as a function of personality trait, but not mood state, whereas AC response to negative stimuli varied as a function of mood state, but not personality trait. Negative mood, but not personality trait, also increased the functional connectivity between AC and other regions. Variance in AC activation can thus be ascribed to an intersubject variable (extraversion) when responding to positive stimuli and an intrasubject variable (mood) when responding to negative stimuli. The former may explain stable differences between extraverts and introverts. The latter may provide an adaptive mechanism to expand an individual's dynamic range in response to potentially dangerous or threatening stimuli.

Consistent activation to fearful expressions may reflect a shared neural mechanism, whereas inconsistence activation to happy facial expressions may reflect individual differences in the personality trait of extraversion, given that amygdala activation to positive emotional scenes varies as a function of this trait. This research examined whether amygdala activation to fearful expressions is independent of extraversion and whether amygdala activation to happy expressions varies with extraversion. Significant amygdala activation across participants was found for fearful expressions only. The findings suggests two processes occurring in the amygdaloid region. The first is engaged consistently across people in response to fearful expressions and may reflect the importance of detecting cues to potentially dangerous situations. The second is engaged variably across people, as a function of extraversion, in response to happy expressions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

	Abstract = {Recently, much progress has been made by those advocating the trait perspective in personality in explicating an underlying dispositional structure to individual differences, to the attributes individuals "have." A cognitive perspective on personality can complement this description, providing a view of what G. W. Allport (1937) called the "doing" side of personality, by focusing on how these dispositions are cognitively expressed and maintained in social interaction. This perspective shows how individuals interpret life tasks of work, play, intimacy, power, and health, in light of their most accessible schemas, envisaging alternative future selves, and devising cognitive strategies to guide behavior. Strategic problem solving has its benefits and its costs because an effective solution to one life problem often creates other new problems. Therefore, a central question about the adaptiveness of personality is raised by this approach. How do individuals modify their schemas, tasks, and strategies in light of experience? A structural approach to personality can reveal much about basic stabilities, and an emphasis on the doing side can contribute knowledge of the mutability of personality.

	Abstract = {Proposes a model of self-directed attention, which includes the following assumptions: When attention is directed to environmental stimuli, those stimuli are analyzed and categorized according to the person's preexisting recognitory schemas. Self-directed attention often leads to a similar analysis of self-information; experientially, such a state of self-focus enhances awareness of one's salient self-aspects. In some cases categorization--either of one's context or of some self-element--elicits a response schema, which constitutes a behavioral standard. If a prior categorization has evoked such a behavioral standard, subsequent self-attention engages an automatic sequence in which behavior is altered to conform more closely with the standard. This matching-to-standard is construed as the occurrence within a psychological system of a test-operate-test-exit unit or a negative feedback loop--a cybernetic construct applicable to many phenomena. If the matching-to-standard process is interrupted, subsequent behavior depends on an outcome expectancy judgment. A favorable outcome expectancy causes a return to the matching-to-standard attempt; an unfavorable expectancy results in behavioral withdrawal.

A tendency to coast is seen as facilitating the shift of attention and effort to other behavioural domains, where they may be needed more or where unforeseen opportunities have arisen.

	Abstract = {Recent revisions to the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) of personality have highlighted the distinction between the emotions of fear and anxiety. These revisions have substantial implications for self-report measurement; in particular, they raise the question of whether separate traits of fear and anxiety exist and, if so, their interrelationship. To address this question, the current study used confirmatory factor analytic procedures to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of measures of trait anxiety, fear, and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS). We also examined measurement and structural invariance across gender in 167 males and 173 females who completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Carver and White BIS Scale, and the Fear Survey Schedule (FSS). The findings suggested that trait anxiety and the BIS scale are relatively distinct from Tissue Damage Fear (FSS). Further, the final model showed measurement and structural invariance across gender. The implications of the results for future selfreport assessment in RST research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

	Abstract = {The 1st of 3 experiments, based on responses from a total sample of 1,100 males aged 35-85, examined the relation between 4 measures of happiness and 7 personality dispositions hypothesized to be related to positive or negative affect. Exp II tested the original hypothesis using measures of the broader dimensions of Neuroticism (N) and Extraversion (E). In Exp III, happiness was predicted from N and E data obtained 10 yrs previously. Based on the results of these studies, it is argued that (a) one set of traits influences positive affect or satisfaction, whereas a different set of traits influences negative affect or dissatisfaction; (b) the former set of traits can be viewed as components of extraversion, and the latter as components of neuroticism; and (c) personality differences antedate and predict differences in happiness over a period of 10 yrs, thus ruling out the rival hypothesis that temporary moods or states account for the observed relations. A model of individual differences in happiness is presented, and the separate and complementary role of trait and adaptation-level theories in explaining happiness are discussed.

Hypotheses derived from the behavioral concordance model that individuals with high scores on a trait would experience more positively valenced affect when engaging in behavior concordant with that trait than individuals with low scores on the trait were tested. Participants completed a questionnaire measure of the traits and reported on behavior and affect during interpersonal interactions using event-contingent sampling forms approximately 6 times a day for 20 days. Trait scores were related to indexes of the association between each dimension of interpersonal behavior and affect calculated for each individual. Previous findings concerning the trait of Agreeableness were replicated, and results strongly supported the behavioral concordance model for the trait of Neuroticism. Thus, at least some traits can provide information about intraindividual processes that vary over time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

There is an increasing recognition that certain personality traits may render individuals vulnerable to psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression. Our purpose in this study was to explore correlates between the personality dimensions neuroticism and extraversion as assessed by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and resting regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRglu) in healthy control subjects. Based on the anxiety and depression literatures, we predicted correlations with a network of brain structures, including ventral and medial prefrontal cortex (encompassing anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex), insular cortex, anterior temporal pole, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. Twenty healthy-women completed an -super(18F)FDG (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography (PET) scan at rest and the NEO-FFI inventory. We investigated correlations between scores on NEO-FFI Neuroticism and Extraversion and rCMRglu using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Within a priori search territories, we found significant negative correlations between Neuroticism and rCMRglu in the insular cortex and positive correlations between Extraversion and rCMRglu in the orbitofrontal cortex. No significant correlations were found involving anterior cingulate, amygdala, or ventral striatum. Neuroticism and Extraversion are associated with activity in insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Personality psychology was used to define the behavioral, emotional, and motivational characteristics of extraversion. A mammalian behavior patter is identified with corresponding characteristics as described in the psychological and ethological literatures.

To determine whether human PE trait levels are also associated with central DA, effects of a specific DA D-sub-2 receptor agonist were assessed in 23 Ss who were widely distributed along the trait dimension of PE. The degree of agonist-induced reactivity in 2 distinct central DA indices was strongly and specifically associated with trait levels of PE, but not with other personality traits.

	Abstract = {Because little is known about the human trait of affiliation, we provide a novel neurobehavioral model of affiliative bonding. Discussion is organized around processes of reward and memory formation that occur during approach and consummately phases of affiliation. Appetitive and consummately reward processes are mediated independently by the activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA)-nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) pathway and the central corticolimbic projections of the mu -opiate system of the medial basal arcuate nucleus, respectively, although these two projection systems functionally interact across time. We next explicate the manner in which DA and glutamate interact in both the VTA and NAS to form incentive-encoded contextual memory ensembles that are predictive of reward derived from affiliative objects. Affiliative stimuli, in particular, are incorporated within contextual ensembles predictive of affiliative reward via: (a) the binding of affiliative stimuli in the rostral circuit of the medial extended amygdala and subsequent transmission to the NAS shell; (b) affiliative stimulus-induced opiate potentiation of DA processes in the VTA and NAS; and (c) permissive or facilitatory effects of gonadal steroids, oxytocin (in interaction with DA), and vasopressin on (i) sensory, perceptual, and attentional processing of affiliative stimuli and (ii) formation of social memories. Among these various processes, we propose that the capacity to experience affiliative reward via opiate functioning has a disproportionate weight in determining individual differences in affiliation. We delineate sources of these individual differences, and provide the first human data that support an association between opiate functioning and variation in trait affiliation.

Children with strong reward/approach systems are likely to develop representations that emphasize potential rewards and frustrations and may become vulnerable to impulsive disorders. Those with strong punishment/avoidance systems may develop representations emphasizing punishment and relief, along with a vulnerability to anxiety disorders.

Within-system organization involves progressive shaping of cortical representations by subcortical motivational systems. As cortical representations develop, they feed back to provide motivational systems with enhanced detection and guidance capabilities. These reciprocal influences may amplify the underlying motivational functions and promote excessive impulsivity or anxiety. However, these processes also depend upon interactions arising between motivational and attentional systems. We discuss these between-system effects by considering the regulation of approach motivation by reactive attentional processes related to fear and by more voluntary processes related to effortful control.

These correlations allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five Aspect Scales [BFAS]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N=480). Finally, the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from 10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002). The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates.

However, the application of Jung's general definitions to the theories shows that Freud's theory, which placed emphasis on the internal, was actually introverted, while Adler's social-interest theory was extroverted. Jung's classification of Adler's and Freud's theories appears to reflect early theorizing. During their later lives, Adler had an extravert-oriented personality theory and was an extravert, while Freud had an internally-oriented personality theory and was an introvert.

Watson, 1991) have asserted that low levels of positive emotionality (PE) are predisposing factors or precursors for depression and represent a form of temperamental risk for depression. Further support for this claim would derive from evidence linking low PE to known indicators of risk for depression. The authors examined the association between temperamental emotionality in young children and parental mood disorders. One hundred unselected preschool-aged children completed a battery of emotion-eliciting tasks tapping aspects of PE, negative emotionality (NE), and behavioral inhibition (BI). Parental psychopathology was assessed with semistructured diagnostic interviews. Low PE in children was associated with maternal, but not paternal, mood disorder. The low PE-maternal depression link was relatively specific, as there were few associations between low PE and other forms of parental psychopathology or between NE and BI and parental mood disorders.

Path analyses indicated that targets' extroversion was associated with their behavioural involvement, which in turn was associated with partners' subsequent ratings of their personality. Targets' interpersonal positive affectivity was associated with their partners' extraversion. Similar patterns of behavioural associations were found in relation to self-reported, partner-reported, and acquaintance-reported extraversion.

	Abstract = {Although neuroticism has been central to most theories of personality, self-reported neuroticism has had limited success in predicting expected behavioral outcomes. The reason for this may be due, in part, to the imprecision of self-reports. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neural correlates of control systems and neuroticism, extraversion, and self-consciousness. In response to an oddball task, neuroticism was associated with increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) reactivity, typically associated with discrepancy detection, whereas extraversion and self-consciousness were associated with lateral and medial frontoparietal networks, respectively, typically associated with task-focused (lateral) or self-focused (medial) controlled processes. We also examined whether the neural measure of neuroticism would predict a relevant behavioral outcome better than self-reports would. Interoceptive accuracy, an outcome associated with neuroticism, was better accounted for by dACC reactivity (rsuperscript 2 = .74) than by self-reported neuroticism (rsuperscript 2 = .16), suggesting that neural reactivities may provide a more direct measure of personality than self-reports do.

Ss also recorded their moods and thoughts by use of an experience-sampling method on 84 occasions over a 3-wk period. Positive affect was found to be most strongly related to striving value and past fulfillment, whereas negative affect was associated with low probability of future success, striving ambivalence, and between-striving conflict. Striving importance and instrumentality (low conflict) were the strongest predictors of life satisfaction. Possible explanations for the connections between striving fulfillment and positive affect and between striving conflict and negative affect are discussed. It is concluded that the concept of personal striving is a useful heuristic device for understanding individual differences in subjective well-being.

Guilford (see record 1975-31795-001), the suggestion is made that psychometric considerations play an important part and that factor analysis in particular can be of great value in this connection. It is also suggested that there are other considerations of at least equal importance. Factors emerging from such analyses must be replicable and reliable, and they must fulfill certain basic psychometric requirements. In addition, there should be evidence of their heritability, they should have theoretical backing leading to objective laboratory verification of deductions from such theories, and they should be socially relevant in the sense of correlating significantly with social parameters. The evidence suggests that there are 3 and only 3 such factors emerging from relevant research, that these are all higher order factors, and that primary factors lack some or all of the qualities required.

Personality study in particular has suffered from this disunity, and the debates about the number of major dimensions of personality. Examples are given to show that by combining methods and theories typical of these two disciplines, one can be put forward paradigms that would be impossible without such unification.

In this context we build up on former studies dealing with the role of E as a possible moderator variable in cortical activation patterns during performance of mental speed, reasoning and working memory tasks (i.e., cognitive information processing). In a sample of 33 introverts and 33 extraverts (31 were male, 35 female) we found extraverted individuals displaying a lower (left-hemispheric) cortical activation than introverts when their task was to judge the identity of two simultaneously presented facial emotions. This effect was only observed in the upper alpha frequency band (~9.6-11.6 Hz). In analyzing E differences during cognitive information processing (i.e., performance of a verbal and a figural-spatial task) E effects--which were moderated by participants' sex--were restricted to lower EEG (alpha) frequency ranges (~5.6-9.6 Hz). The results generally suggest that E is differently involved when different kinds of information are processed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

	Abstract = {Utilized positron emission tomographic measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to investigate central neural differences in extraversion and neuroticism, as determined by the Swedish version of the NEO Personality Inventory--Revised Edition. Ss were 30 22-42-yr-old females. A median-split defined extraverts from introverts and relatively more and less neurotic Ss. The relative rCBF in the caudate nucleus and the putamen was higher in introverts than extraverts. In introverts, activity in the putamen was left-lateralized. These areas have high concentrations of dopamine terminals, implicating a dopaminergic basis for individual differences in extraversion. As a function of Extraversion, rCBF did not differ in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, temporopolar, cingulate, primary visual cortex, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus. Thus, individual differences in extraversion correlated to subcortical rather than cortical brain regions. Because introverted Ss displayed an increased neuronal activity in brain regions previously associated with learning and motor and vigilance control, a subcortical neostriatal and possibly dopaminergic, rather than a solely cortical correlate of the personality dimension extraversion was supported.

Within-person variability was high, such that the typical individual regularly and routinely manifested nearly all levels of all traits in his or her everyday behavior. Second, individual differences in central tendencies of behavioral distributions were almost perfectly stable. Third, amount of behavioral variability (and skew and kurtosis) were revealed as stable individual differences. Finally, amount of within-person variability in extraversion was shown to reflect individual differences in reactivity to extraversion-relevant situational cues. Thus, decontextualized and noncontigent Big-Five content is highly useful for descriptions of individuals' density distributions as wholes. Simultaneously, contextualized and contingent personality units (e.g., conditional traits, goals) are needed for describing the considerable within-person variation.

	Abstract = {Two studies investigated whether situations are associated with the manifestation of Big Five trait contents in behavior. Several times per day for 2 or 5 weeks, participants reported their current Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability states and rated the concurrent situation on several characteristics. Multilevel models tested for the average individual's contingency of each Big Five state on each situation characteristic and for whether individuals differed from each other reliably in those contingencies. Results showed that (1) there are psychologically active characteristics of situations on which trait-manifesting behavior is contingent; (2) contingencies on psychologically active characteristics of varying situations are part of the explanation for the sizeable within-person variability in behavior; (3) individuals differ reliably in their contingencies, and such individual differences may partially explain individual differences in amount of variability; and (4) the situation characteristics that are psychologically active differ by trait. These findings suggest that within-person variability in personality states is meaningful and is related to situations, that personality psychology should characterize situations in terms of their relevance to personality states, and that process and individual-difference structure approaches can be integrated in personality psychology.

The solution described in this chapter has four components: experience-sampling methodology (ESM), multilevel modeling (MLM), psychologically active properties of situations, and personality states. Personality states that change from occasion to occasion are the dynamic dependent variables. Psychologically active properties of situations are identified as the situation variables. ESM allows assessment of behaviors across representative samples of situation properties and situation strengths. MLM allows analyzing both which properties are relevant and how much individuals differ in their reactions to those properties. Finally, combined, the methods are reasonably convenient. Although this solution may not satisfy all criticisms of interactionism, it has promise for understanding what people do in their everyday lives to try to make things better.

In Study 1, participants reported their extraversion and positive affect every 3 hr for 2 weeks. Each participant was happier when acting extraverted than when acting introverted. Study 2's diary methodology replicated the relationship for weekly variations in positive affect. Study 3's experimental methodology replicated the relationship when extraversion was manipulated within a fixed situation. Thus, the relationship between extraversion and positive affect, previously demonstrated between persons, also characterizes the internal, ongoing psychological functioning of individuals and is likely to be explained by something capable of rapid intraindividual variation. Furthermore, traits and states are at least somewhat isomorphic, and acting extraverted may increase well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

	Abstract = {Serotonin constrains a broad array of animal and human behavior and may also inhibit the expression of mood or affective states among humans. For the most part, this research has focused on the association of central serotonergic function with negative affectivity (i.e., anxiety, depression, hostility), with less attention on the relationship between serotonergic function and positive affect or mood. The current study was conducted to examine the relationship between a measure of central serotonergic activity and daily ratings of positive and negative mood in a nonpatient sample. Two hundred and fifty-four adults, aged 24-60, completed end-of-day ratings of positive and negative mood items over 7 consecutive days. A neuropharmacological challenge was administered to index central serotonergic function, i.e., the maximal prolactin (PRL) response to fenfluramine, a serotonin-releasing agent. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that the peak PRL response to fenfluramine was positively associated with positive mood, averaged over 7 days, after controlling for known predictors of the PRL response. This relationship remained significant after controlling for average negative mood, for the presence of a current DSM-III-R diagnosis, and for trait measures of Neuroticism and Extraversion. In contrast, the PRL response to fenfluramine was not associated with average negative mood, although it was inversely correlated with trait negative affectivity (i.e., Neuroticism). These results suggest that deficiencies in serotonergic function may reflect the relative absence of positive mood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Using structural equation modeling procedures with 2 samples of Ss (205 Ss in Sample 1 and 241 Ss in Sample 2), the authors demonstrated that evaluation fully mediated the relationship between neuroticism and negative affect and partially mediated the relationship between extraversion and positive affect.

Three challenges for the next generation of research are to integrate these disparate approaches to personality (particularly the trait and social-cognitive paradigms), to remedy the imbalance in the person-situation-behavior triad by conceptualizing the basic properties of situations and behaviors, and to add to personality psychology's thin inventory of basic facts concerning the relations between personality and behavior.

Previously reported data are summarized that demonstrate how behavior can vary as a function of subtle situational changes while individual consistency is maintained. Further discussion considers the personal source of behavioral invariance, the situational source of behavioral variation, the person-situation interaction, the nature of behavior, and the "personality triad" of persons, situations, and behaviors, in which each element is understood and predicted in terms of the other two. An important goal for future research is further development of theories and methods for conceptualizing and measuring the functional aspects of situations and of behaviors. One reason for the persistence of the person situation debate may be that it serves as a proxy for a deeper, implicit debate over values such as equality vs. individuality, determinism vs. free will, and flexibility vs. consistency. However, these value dichotomies may be as false as the person-situation debate that they implicitly drive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Behavioral consistency was examined in terms of single behaviors and person-centered behavioral profiles. Addressing subjective situational similarity, Study 1 showed that participants who rated the two situations as relatively similar were relatively consistent in their behavior across the situations. Addressing objective situational similarity, defined as the degree to which situations shared common elements, Study 2 showed that participants were more behaviorally consistent across similar pairs of situations than across dissimilar pairs. In addition, Study 2 found that behaviors that are relatively automatic and impulsive were more consistent than behaviors that are more controlled and cognitively mediated. Regardless of how situational similarity or behavioral consistency were operationalized, greater similarity was related to greater consistency.

In the 1st of 3 studies, 1,431 trait adjectives grouped into 75 clusters were analyzed; virtually identical structures emerged in 10 replications, each based on a different factor-analytic procedure.

Gray's, and J. P. Newman's theories. Initially, 143 participants' (aged 18-25 yrs) levels of extraversion (as measured by the sociability subscale) and neuroticism were assessed with Eysenck's Personality Inventory. They were then tested individually. After completing a questionnaire of current positive and negative moods, they completed 3 tasks measuring processing of pleasant, unpleasant, and also neutral information. The results show that extraversion was associated positively with the processing of pleasant information, while neuroticism was associated positively with the processing of unpleasant information. These findings support predictions from Eysenck's theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

A group of 268 male and female 12-13 yr olds completed questionnaires covering these measures. Results indicated that in male Ss, extraversion predicted all 3 coping styles positively. Neuroticism also predicted avoidance coping positively, and it exacerbated the effect of extraversion on all three coping styles.

	Abstract = {On both psychological and physiological grounds it is suggested that the hypothesis in Eysenck's theory of introversion-extroversion attributing greater conditionability to the introvert should be replaced by the hypothesis that the introvert is relatively more sensitive to punishment and to frustrative nonreward. The data on which this conclusion is based stem chiefly from the study of eyeblink conditioning in man as a function of personality, and from the study of physiological locus of action of the extroverting drug, sodium amobarbital, in animals. It is suggested that the physiological basis of introversion includes, besides the ascending reticular activating system, an inhibitory system comprising the orbital frontal cortex, the medial septal area, and the hippocampus. This system is able to carry out the essential psychological functions believed by Eysenck to underlie introversion-extroversion. A new conception of neuroticism as reflecting degree of sensitivity to both reward and punishment is also proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

In Study 1, 102 male undergraduate students (classified as either introvert or extravert based on the Extraversion scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) evaluated games on rating scales. All Ss rated the competitive game as more arousing and potentially punishing than the cooperative game, but introverts anticipated that the competitive game would be less friendly and likable than did the extraverts. In Study 2, 61 undergraduates believed they would participate in either a cooperative or a competitive game. Ss were shown slides of all other Ss (teammates and opponents), as well as bogus biographical information. Ss were then asked to recall information and evaluate each S on rating scales. Introverts recalled more information about opponents than about their own teammates and rated all Ss less positively during the competitive encounter. For extraverts, this pattern was reversed.

The expectancies, in combination with implicit theories of personality development, support stability and patterned change. This multimethod study examined the relations among motor activity differences, temperament, and expectations about future personality characteristics in preschool children. It was hypothesized that motor activity and temperament differences would be linked to teachers' expectations about later personality development. The hypothesis that expectations about such links would be moderated by the sex of the child was also examined. Outcomes generally corroborated hypotheses.

In psychological assessment, the many popular personality inventories available in the marketplace also may be useful, but their comparative validity has long remained unassessed. This is the first comprehensive comparison of 11 such multiscale instruments against each of three types of criteria: clusters of behavioral acts, descriptions by knowledgeable informants, and clinical indicators potentially associated with various types of psychopathology. Using 1,000 bootstrap resampling analyses from a sample of roughly 700 adult research participants, we assess the relative predictability of each criterion and the comparative validity of each inventory. Although there was a wide range of criterion predictability, most inventories exhibited quite similar cross-validities when averaged across all three types of criteria. On the other hand, there were important differences between inventories in their predictive capabilities for particular criteria. We discuss the factors that lead to differential validity across predictors and criteria. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Our current research efforts are directed at understanding the temporal dynamics of networks of structures associated with particular personality traits, and gain insights into the functional contributions of more narrowly defined trait-facets that comprise these personality traits. To begin this process, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using an emotional attention task (emotional Stroop paradigm) and addressed the question whether individual differences in extraversion and its lower-level facets were associated with differences in activation, and in functional connectivity, of the anterior cingulate (AC) cortex. We replicated our earlier finding that extraversion was associated with increased AC activation to positive, relative to neutral, word stimuli, but now show that distinct facets of extraversion can account for this association. When analyzing for functional connectivity, we found that greater extraversion across individuals was associated with greater functional connectivity between the AC and the inferior parietal lobule, and that this association could also be accounted for by distinct facets of extraversion. Our data suggest that extraversion and some of its lower-level facets are associated with individual differences across a network of structures believed to be critical in cognitive and affective processing.

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) It is well established that depression and anxiety are associated with abnormal patterns of asymmetrical brain activity, particularly in frontal regions (e.g., Heller, Nitschke, & Miller, 1998). Data in support of this finding have highlighted the relative roles of left and right frontal regions in positive and negative emotions, respectively (e.g., Davidson & Irwin, 1999). In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that asymmetrical brain function can be understood not only in terms of theories of emotion, but also in terms of specific personality constructs. Despite decades of electroencephalographic (EEC) research identifying frontal asymmetries in emotion and personality, these findings have been largely unreplicated by hemodynamic studies (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] and positron emission tomography [PET]). This chapter briefly reviews evidence regarding the contribution of frontal brain asymmetries to understanding components of emotion, motivation, and personality. The review is followed by a more detailed consideration of how frontal brain asymmetries can and should be quantified via hemodynamic imaging measures-methodologies that are currently highly underutilized in neuroimaging research. An example of a recent study in our laboratory that illustrates some of the methodology discussed is also presented (Herrington et al., 2005).

Ss were 269 18-83 yr olds who completed measures of HP, EX, cognitive style, and other aspects of individual personality (IP). Based on the data collected, Ss were divided into 4 groups: happy extraverts, happy introverts, unhappy introverts, and unhappy extraverts. The results show that, although EX is associated with HP, the correlations of other IP differences (life satisfaction) appear to be greater and, in some cases, substantially independent of EX. The results also identify several Ss as happy introverts. Data concerning these Ss suggest that many of the behaviours of happy introverts and happy extraverts seem virtually identical. Overall, these findings suggest that the mechanism by which introversion-extraversion affects HP may be different from that of other variables. Further, it might better be considered as an instrumental variable that mediates the ways individuals choose to achieve their own happiness.

	Abstract = {After a general presentation of the nature of scientific theory in its deductive aspects and a defense of an objective point of view with reference to molar adaptive behavior in contrast to subjectivism, teleology, and emergentism, the author gives a detailed exposition of the fundamental principles of behavior. Innate behavior and its relation to the termination of needs are basic facts, as are also such physiological events as sensory after-discharge and internal oscillatory, variable factors. The development of the theory offers an account of behavior in terms of reinforcement, generalization, motivation, inhibition, oscillation, and response evocation which may be thought of as a chain of conditions beginning with the physical stimulus and ending in the response. 13 major symbolic constructs, directly or indirectly anchored to 6 objectively observable events, are utilized in explanation of the above chain of conditions of behavior. An examination of stimulus compounds and patterns leads the author, in opposition to Gestalt psychology, to the view that patterning is a secondary rather than a primary principle of behavior. The 22 chapters of the book contain lists of references, technical notes, and derivations of formulae. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

A general information-processing model that accounts for the systematic effects of these motivational states on certain task components (sustained information transfer and some aspect of short-term memory) is proposed. Empirical generalizations about task components in a structural model are combined, and testable predictions that differentiate alternative motivational hypotheses are derived.

In the final reduced model the proportion of the genetic variance of the Control scale in common with the SSS was estimated as 55%, and the rest of the genetic variance was attributed to the genetic variance specific to the Control scale.

Measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were obtained from 18 healthy Ss (aged 19-48 yrs) by means of [superscript 1-sup-5O]H-sub-2O positron emission tomography. Correlations of regional CBF with introversion/extraversion were calculated, and a three-dimensional map of those correlations was generated. Overall, introversion was associated with increased blood flow in the frontal lobes and in the anterior thalamus. Regions in the anterior cingulate gyrus, the temporal lobes, and the posterior thalamus were found to be correlated with extraversion. The findings of the study lend support to the notion that introversion is associated with increased activity in frontal lobe regions. Moreover, the study suggests that individual differences in introversion and extraversion are related to differences in a fronto-striato-thalamic circuit.

A random general population sample (ages 20-70 years), from two Finnish cities was surveyed with the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). In addition, questions regarding diagnosed lifetime mental disorders, health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months, and history of mental disorders in first-degree relatives were posed. Among the 441 subjects who participated, neuroticism correlated strongly with symptoms of depression (r-sub(s)=.71, P<.001) and anxiety (r-sub(s)=.69, P<.001), and somewhat with selfreported lifetime mental disorder (r-sub(s)=.30, P<.001) and health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months (r-sub(s)=.24, P<.001). Extraversion correlated negatively with symptoms of depression (r-sub(s)=-.47, P<.001), anxiety (r-sub(s)=-.36, P<.001), selfreported lifetime mental disorder (r-sub(s)=-.17, P<.001), and health care use for psychiatric reasons in the past 12 months (r-sub(s)=-.14, P=.004). In multiple regression models, even after adjusting for gender, age, and education, BDI scores were significantly associated with neuroticism, extraversion, and age, whereas BAI scores were associated only with neuroticism. Neuroticism is strongly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, and intraversion is moderately associated with depressive symptoms in the urban general population. The relationship of these personality dimensions to both self-reported lifetime mental disorders and use of health services for psychiatric reasons strengthens the clinical validity of these personality dimensions.

In Studies 1-3, introverts exhibited a nonverbal decoding deficit, relative to extraverts, but only when decoding was a secondary rather than a primary task within a multitasking context. In Study 4, extraversion was found to correlate with central executive efficiency (r=.42) but not with storage capacity (r=.04).

Results from a longitudinal diary study and 2 experiments show that positive and negative goal-related emotions can have diametrically opposing effects on goal-directed behavior, depending on the individual's proximity to goal attainment. The findings resolve contrasting predictions about the influence of positive and negative emotions in volitional behavior, critically amend the goal gradient hypothesis, and provide new insights into the dynamics and determinants of multiple-goal pursuit.

	Abstract = {Six mood induction studies and a meta-analysis were conducted to test 2 models of the extraversion-pleasant affect relation. The affect-level model suggests that extraverts should be happier than introverts in both neutral and positive mood conditions. The reactivity model posits that extraverts react particularly strongly to pleasant stimuli and that they should be happier than introverts only in positive conditions. In all studies, extraverts failed to exhibit greater emotional reactivity when pleasantness items were analyzed. When activated positive affect items were analyzed, results were mixed.

	Abstract = {Extraversion is a broad, multifaceted trait, yet researchers are still unsure of its defining characteristics. One possibility is that the essential feature of extraversion is the tendency to enjoy social situations. An alternative possibility is that extraversion represents sensitivity to rewards and the tendency to experience pleasant affect. In three studies, participants rated situations that varied on two dimensions: (a) whether they were social or nonsocial and (b) whether they were very pleasant, moderately pleasant, moderately unpleasant, or very unpleasant. Extraverts only rated social situations more positively than introverts did when the situations were pleasant, and extraverts also rated nonsocial situations more positively than introverts did if the situations were pleasant. Thus, the pleasantness of situations was more important than whether they were social or nonsocial in determining extraverts' and introverts' enjoyment.

	Abstract = {Psychologists have not determined the defining characteristics of extraversion. In four studies, the authors tested the hypothesis that extraversion facets are linked by reward sensitivity. According to this hypothesis, only facets that reflect reward sensitivity should load on a higher order extraversion factor. This model was tested against a model in which sociability links the facets. The authors also tested the generalizability of the model in a diverse sample of participants from 39 nations, and they tested the model using widely used extraversion scales. Results of all studies indicate that only facets that reflect reward sensitivity load on a higher order extraversion factor and that this factor correlates strongly with pleasant affect. Although sociability is undoubtedly an important part of extraversion, these results suggest that extraverts' sociability may be a by-product of reward sensitivity, rather than the core feature of the trait.

	Abstract = {Background: Personality traits are associated with substance dependence (SD); genetic factors may influence both. Strong associations between ADH4 variation and SD have been reported. We aimed to investigate the relationship between ADH4 variation and personality traits in the present study. Methods: We assessed dimensions of the five-factor model of personality in 243 subjects with SD (175 European Americans [EAs] and 68 African Americans [AAs]) and 296 healthy control subjects (256 EAs and 40 AAs). We also genotyped 7 ADH4 markers (spanning the locus) and 38 unlinked ancestry-informative markers in these subjects. The relationships between the diplotypes, alleles, and genotypes at ADH4 and personality traits were examined using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), controlling for potential confounders. Results: Generally, SD patients, older individuals, and male subjects scored higher on neuroticism and lower on other personality factors. Personality factors were associated with the diplotypes. The allele A or genotype A/A of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)6 (rs1800759 at the gene promoter) was significantly associated with agreeableness scores. There were associations between extraversion and SNP1 (hcv2033010 at the 32 end) and SNP2 (rs1042364 in exon 9) in subjects with higher conscientiousness scores. Conclusions: The personality traits of agreeableness and extraversion are related to ADH4 polymorphism. Among the ADH4 markers that appear to predispose to certain personality traits, the functional variant rs1800759 (SNP6) in the promoter region is most important. We conclude that personality traits and SD have a partially overlapping genetic basis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that positive affect--the hallmark of well-being--may be the cause of many of the desirable characteristics, resources, and successes correlated with happiness.

The evolved motive dispositions at the core of personality anchor a hierarchy of levels of cognitive and behavioral functioning aimed at attaining or avoiding the affective states central to these personality systems. These systems are seen as in dynamic conflict within individuals and as highly compartmentalized in their functioning between settings.

At the level of universal mechanisms, personality systems are species typical systems with adaptive functions in the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness. At the level of group differences, the evolutionary theory of sex, parent-offspring conflict theory, and life history are used to analyze sex, age, and ethnic differences in personality systems.

Humans evaluate and act on the genetic and phenotypic diversity represented by this range of viable strategies to solve adaptive problems.

Additive genetic and nonshared environmental correlations between scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory--an index of abnormal personality--and the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire--an index of normal personality--were estimated. Results indicated that phenotypic correlations between normal and abnormal personality were mediated by genetic as well as environmental factors, although the magnitude of genetic mediation tended to be larger overall. Moreover, the patterns of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental relationships among the scales were similar, suggesting that influences on normal and abnormal personality act through systems common to both.

Eysenck's theory concerns the extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism traits, whereas Gray proposed the use of the rotated axes of impulsivity and anxiety. Eysenck used multiple arousal systems as central explanatory constructs, whereas Gray describes more specific systems related to behavioral inhibition and activation. The authors review evidence relating to these theories and discuss key predictive successes and failures and methodological problems. There is a core of support for the Eysenck theory in some paradigms, such as the moderator effect of stimulation level on individual differences in phasic electrodermal response and eyelid conditioning. In other settings, the theory fails to explain empirical data adequately, especially in studies of subjective response and attention and performance. Gray's theory has advanced research through stimulating interest in moderation of personality effects by motivational variables and provides a better explanation than Eysenck's theory for certain data, such as instrumental conditioning to reward stimuli and the positive affectivity of extraverts.

New evidence for intrinsic maturation is offered from analyses of NEO Five-Factor Inventory scores for men and women age 14 and over in German, British, Spanish, Czech, and Turkish samples (N=5,085). These data support strong conceptual links to child temperament despite modest empirical associations.

We employed an experimental methodology to manipulate state extraversion and state neuroticism to determine their causal status. In Experiment 1, state extraversion was manipulated by instructing participants to act extraverted and introverted during two different discussions with two other participants. Participants reported more positive affect when instructed to act extraverted than when instructed to act introverted, and this finding was supported by the ratings of observers. In Experiment 2, state neuroticism was manipulated by instructing participants to act neurotic and emotionally stable during two different discussions. Participants reported more negative affect when instructed to act neurotic than when instructed to act stable. Thus, at least some part of the extraversion-positive affect and neuroticism-negative affect relationships may be accounted for by the causal influences of extraverted behavior and neurotic behavior, respectively.

This paper argues that personality axes such as extraversion can usefully be seen as dimensions of trade-off of different fitness costs and benefits. It is hypothesized that increasing extraversion will be associated with increasing mating success, but at the cost of either increased physical risk or decreased parenting effort. In a sample of 545 British adults, extraversion was a strong predictor of lifetime number of sexual partners. Male extraverts were likely to have extra-pair matings, whilst female extraverts were likely to leave existing relationships for new ones. On the cost side, increasing extraversion increased the likelihood of hospitalization for accident or illness. There was no direct evidence of reduced parenting effort, but extravert women had an increased likelihood of exposing their children to stepparenting. The study demonstrates that extraversion has fitness costs as well as benefits. Population variation related in the trait is unlikely to be eliminated by selection due to its polygenic nature, likely spatiotemporal variability in the optimal value, and possible status- and frequency-dependent selection.

The traits were significantly related with all the motives (adjusted R2 = .06 to .43) except Physical Activity. Four motives were related with only one trait and nine configurations of two or more traits were correlated with the remaining 11 motives. Total motive scores across all participants, an index of the strength of overall motivation, were positively correlated with Extraversion and Neuroticism and negatively with Agreeableness.

Extraversion was positively correlated with gray matter concentration in the left amygdala, whereas neuroticism was negatively correlated with gray matter concentration in the right amygdala. Given that neuroticism is a risk factor for depression, our finding offers one explanation as to why prior structural imaging studies of depressed patients (which did not control for personality) produced conflicting findings. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the view that amygdala reduction seen in depressed patients precedes the onset of the disease, rather than being a consequence of the illness.

After an initial discussion of historical background and of the technical methods employed, Pavlov discusses the following topics: the formation of conditioned reflexes by means of conditioned and direct stimuli; external and internal inhibition of conditioned reflexes; the analyzing and synthesizing activity of the cerebral hemisphere; irradiation and concentration of nervous processes in the cerebral cortex; mutual induction of excitation and inhibition; interaction of irradiation and concentration with induction; the cortex as a mosaic of functions; development of inhibition in the cortex under the influence of conditioned stimuli; internal inhibition and sleep as one and the same process with regard to their intimate mechanism; transition stages between the alert state and complete sleep-hypnotic stages; different types of nervous system; pathological disturbances of the cortex, result of functional and surgical interference; general characteristics of the present investigation and its special difficulties; discovery of certain errors necessitating the modification of some earlier interpretations; and the experimental results obtained with animals in their application to man. Attention is drawn to the similarity of the neuroses and psychoses to behavior observed in the dog during certain of the experiments.

They showed that positive mood induction was positively correlated with E and negative mood induction was positively correlated with N and negatively correlated with E. In neither case did an N*E interaction term explain any variance in mood induction over and above that explained by the trait measures entered separately. They argued that the absence of this interaction term was critical evidence for the failure of Gray's theory of E and N and concluded that these data would fit better within Eysenck's original theoretical framework. This commentary argues that these conclusions are based on an incorrect account of Gray's theory. The correct interpretation is that individuals' susceptibilities to punishment and reward signals (e.g. mood induction cues) are predicted to be additive combinations of E and N, so that statistical interactions between E and N in explaining mood induction are not expected under this theory. The reasons why Rusting and Larsen may have mistakenly placed so much emphasis on N*E interactions are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

All groups experienced positive and negative induced mood in two separate sessions with 2 weeks interval. After mood induction in each session, subjects performed three cognitive tasks: free recall, probability rating and story completion. The findings revealed that subjects with higher extraversion, made more positive judgments and interpretations in the positive mood condition; and individuals with higher neuroticism, made more negative judgments and interpretations in the negative mood condition; but extraverted and neurotic subjects did not differ significantly in the number of positive and negative recalled words in the two mood conditions.

From 152 longitudinal studies, 3,217 test-retest correlation coefficients were compiled. Meta-analytic estimates of mean population test-retest correlation coefficients showed that trait consistency increased from .31 in childhood to .54 during the college years, to .64 at age 30, and then reached a plateau around .74 between ages 50 and 70 when time interval was held constant at 6.7 years. Analysis of moderators of consistency showed that the longitudinal time interval had a negative relation to trait consistency and that temperament dimensions were less consistent than adult personality traits.

	Abstract = {The ability of personality traits to predict important life outcomes has traditionally been questioned because of the putative small effects of personality. In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes.

In a series of three studies involving 236 undergraduates, the authors found that introverts who were skilled at categorizing events as threatening (vs. introverts slow to do so) experienced more negative affect in their daily lives. Among extraverts, threat categorization performance did not predict negative affect. The authors suggest that implicit threat categorizations render individuals vulnerable to negative affect but that high levels of Extraversion are capable of inhibiting such affective consequences.

Such tendencies were hypothesized to tap individual differences in threat reactivity processes and therefore be relevant to the prediction of phobic-like fear (Study 1) and displayed anxiety as rated by informants (Studies 2 and 3). However, on the basis of the idea that high levels of extraversion may suppress threat reactivity processes, it was hypothesized that extraversion and post-error slowing tendencies would interact in predicting the dependent measures. The studies supported the latter interactive hypothesis in that post-error slowing tendencies were predictive of displayed anxiety at low, but not high, levels of extraversion. The discussion focuses on the respective roles of error-reactivity processes and extraversion in predicting behavioral inhibition and displayed anxiety.

This chapter explores both historical influences and more recent advances in our understanding of individual differences in temperament. The chapter begins with a brief history of temperament research, considering its recent history, its ancient roots, and its study in adulthood. The 2nd section examines the structure of temperament as it has emerged from research on child development and from some of the major neural models. The chapter also considers results of the search for a taxonomic structure of adult personality traits, and relates temperament structure to the resulting Big Three and Big Five factors of personality. The 3rd section discusses methods and measures for the study of temperament, considering both the benefits and liabilities of some of the major empirical approaches. Because the use of parent-report in temperament research has been questioned, the authors critically consider contributions of parent-report. The 4th section focuses on temperament and development, considering issues of continuity and change. The 5th section discusses relations between temperament and behavioral adjustment. The final section presents conclusions and indicates future directions for the study of temperament and development.

	Abstract = {This article reviews evidence for the roles that mood states and personality traits play in the processing of emotion-congruent information across different cognitive tasks. Evidence is reviewed for 3 emotion-congruency frameworks, each summarizing a different route to emotional processing: the traditional approach, a moderation approach, and a mediation approach. Most of the traditional literature includes studies that examine the effects of moods and traits on emotional processing separately; these studies have yielded some inconsistent findings. The moderation and mediation approaches offer potential solutions to the lack of consistency obtained in the traditional literature by allowing for the combined effects of personality traits and mood states on the processing of emotional information. The moderation approach suggests that mood states interact with individual differences in emotion-relevant personality traits to influence emotion-congruent processing. The mediation approach suggests that personality traits predispose individuals to certain mood states, which then influence emotional processing. These approaches provide a framework for understanding the literature and a starting point for future research on emotion-congruent processing.

In Study 1, participants filled out measures of personality and natural mood and then completed a series of memory and judgment tasks. The same procedure was used in Study 2, except a positive or negative mood state was induced prior to completion of the cognitive tasks. Extraversion and positive affectivity were related to retrieval of positive memories and the tendency to make positive judgments. Neuroticism and negative affectivity were related to retrieval of negative memories and the tendency to make negative judgments. In addition, several significant personality by mood interaction effects on memory and judgment were obtained in Study 2, which suggests that personality and mood effects on cognition are not independent of one another. Discussion focuses on integrating mood-congruency theories with personality theories and specifying the conditions under which mood by trait interaction effects emerge.

Eysenck's model predicts that extraversion (EXT) should relate to positive affect, but not negative affect, and that neuroticism (NRT) should relate to negative affect, but not positive affect. The Gray/Newman model asserts that there should be an interaction between EXT and NRT in predicting positive and negative affect, such that the relationship between NRT and affect depends on one's position on the EXT dimension. Results best fit predictions derived from Eysenck's model. EXT was positively related to positive affect following a pleasant mood induction, and neuroticism was positively related to negative affect following a negative mood induction. There was no evidence for an extraversionxneuroticism interaction in predicting emotional reactions, as would be expected from the Gray/Newman model. Two different theoretical models have been used to explain relationships between the personality dimensions of EXT and NRT and the affect dimensions of positive and negative mood.

A confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable fit between responses on measures of transitory states and the Big Five dimensions. Further, the state measures of the Big Five dimensions had good internal consistency. As one would expect, each Big Five state was more related to the corresponding Big Five trait than to other Big Five traits. As expected on the basis of previous research, higher levels of state surgency were associated with higher levels of state positive mood, and higher levels of state emotional stability were associated with lower levels of state negative mood. Unexpectedly, state conscientiousness was also highly associated with state positive mood. Because one would expect states to be changeable, the second study used an experimental manipulation to attempt to change levels of the Big Five States. All states changed in the expected direction; however, only the changes in state surgency, agreeableness, and openness were statistically significant.

Second, we evaluate recent clarifications relating to interdependent effects that these systems may have on behavior, in addition to or in place of separable effects (e.g., Corr, 2001; Pickering, 1997). Finally, we consider ambiguities regarding the exact trait dimension to which Gray's "reward system" corresponds. From this review, we suggest that future work is needed to distinguish psychometric measures of (a) fear from anxiety and (b) reward-reactivity from trait impulsivity. We also suggest, on the basis of interdependent system views of RST and associated exploration using formal models, that traits that are based upon RST are likely to have substantial intercorrelations. Finally, we advise that more substantive work is required to define relevant constructs and behaviors in RST before we can be confident in our psychometric measures of them.

	Abstract = {Compared the relative accuracy of targets' self-reports and other-reports of personality in predicting 2 criteria: (1) emotional experience in daily life and (2) behavior in the laboratory. Ratings of 182 college students targets' extraversion and neuroticism were obtained from 2 knowledgeable informants and the targets themselves. Target Ss wore an electronic signaling device ("beeper") for 8 days and rated positive and negative emotions at 4 randomly selected times each day. The Ss also interacted with an opposite-sex stranger in a laboratory context and their behavior was coded from videotapes. Results show that targets' self-reports of personality were consistently more accurate than other-reports in predicting daily emotional experience. Self-reports also outperformed other-reports in predicting extraversion-related laboratory behaviors, but not neuroticism-related behaviors. It is concluded that the relative accuracy of self- and other-reports of personality would seem to depend on the criterion employed, and that self-reports are clearly better for the prediction of emotional experience, while for behavior the picture is mixed.

Much of this research, however, focuses on measures of dysfunctional behavior and relatively fewer studies have focused on positive traits.

Using a sample of 336 middle-aged twins drawn from the Minnesota Twin Registry who completed the VIA inventory of strengths, we detected significant genetic and non-shared environmental effects for 21 of 24 character strengths with little evidence of shared environmental contributions. Associations with a previously administered measure of normal personality found moderate phenotypic overlap and that genetic influences on personality traits could account for most, but not all, of the heritable variance in character strengths.

Extraverts were faster to link events to their personal motivations when in a positive mood state, whereas introverts were fast to do so in a neutral or negative mood state. Further findings indicate that this interaction affects attitude accessibility rather than event elaboration.

However, little has been said about the source of these relations. The present study proposes cognitive evaluation as a potential source. Specifically, it is argued that when evaluating events, extraverts ascribe weight to their positive aspects and neurotics to their negative aspects, a difference that brings about corresponding differences in affective reactions. To explore this idea, 226 participants were asked to evaluate 30 hypothetical everyday events. Each event was evaluated along two independent scales referring to the positivity and the negativity of the event. The participants also completed a personality questionnaire and reported on their momentary affective state. The results supported the hypothesis by showing that extraversion correlated with a more positive (but not less negative) rating of events, whereas neuroticism correlated with a more negative (but not less positive) rating of events. Regression analyses ruled out the possibility that momentary affective state accounts for these effects. The study shows the different yet complementary ways through which extraversion and neuroticism contribute to reality perception. With that, a new dimension is added to the understanding of personality-affect relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

Significant genetic effects on both traits were found, at all ages, in men and women, on each measurement occasion. For E, heritability was invariant across sex but decreased from late adolescence to the late 20s, with a smaller additional decrease at about 50 yrs of age. Heritability for N also decreased from late adolescence to late 20s and remained stable thereafter. For all ages after the early 20s, heritability of N was significantly higher among women. Means for E and N were sex-dependent and, apparently, influenced by cohort and time of assessment, as well as by age. There was little evidence of new genetic contributions to individual differences after age 30; in contrast, significant new environmental effects emerged at every age.

	Abstract = {A recent theory suggests that the agency facet of Extraversion (E) is based on brain dopamine (DA). The paucity of human data relevant to this model is probably due to the lack of widely accessible noninvasive psychophysiological indices and well-established behavioral measures sensitive to both E and manipulations of DA activity. Aiming to identify such measures, the authors assessed the electroencephalogram and n-back task performance in groups of introverts and extraverts after administration of either placebo or a selective DA D2 receptor antagonist. As predicted, the antagonist's effects on n-back reaction time measures and frontal versus parietal electroencephalogram theta activity were strongly and specifically modulated by E.

Each day they rated (a) their mood, (b) the extent to which they suffered from various minor physical problems, (c) their level of stress, (d) the time they spent socializing, and (e) whether or not they had exercised. Subjects also completed several trait tests measuring their general affective level, frequency of health problems, and social tendencies. A between-subjects analysis showed the expected pattern: Level of physical complaints and perceived stress were correlated with individual differences in NA but not in PA, whereas social indicators and frequency of exercise were related only to PA. The within-subjects results generally exhibited a similar pattern: Social activity and exercise were more strongly related to PA, whereas perceived stress was highly related to NA. However, the most significant finding was that, contrary to prediction, health complaints were as strongly related to intraindividual fluctuations in PA as in NA. Possible interpretations of the observed correlates of NA and PA are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

The book shows how this continuous "stream of affect" is regulated by 2 general biobehavioral systems associated with negative and positive mood states, respectively. The evolutionary origins of these 2 basic systems are discussed, as are their affective, cognitive, biological, and behavioral components. With attention to salient theoretical and measurement issues, chapters examine short-term fluctuation in mood that result from such factors as stress, social activity, exercise, and weather, as well as from endogenous cycles or rhythms. The author then establishes the stability of affective levels over time and across different life contexts. Exploring the underlying consistency, he relates affectivity to the traits comprising the 5-factor model of personality. Finally, these biologically based individual differences are shown to have profound implications for theories of happiness, as well as for mental and physical health.

The FFM is contrasted with an alternative model of personality derived in part from clinical observation and interpretation of narratives, which can be quantified using Q-sort methodology.

Extraversion, sociability, and impulsivity as measured by the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) were used to predict students' ratings of hypothetical situations of cooperation and competition. For the sample as a whole, ratings of the two kinds of activity are similar to those found by Graziano et al. When extraversion is used as a predictor, however, our data differ from theirs in several ways. A crucial finding emerges from stepwise regression analyses, which show that for each rating dimension, most of the variance explained by EPI variables is accounted for by either sociability or impulsivity. This implies that Graziano et al.'s analysis, which was conducted entirely at the level of extraversion, was too gross; consequently, their interpretation may be incorrect. The data have implications for the theories of Gray (1981) and Eysenck (1967), although neither of these positions appears capable of explaining all aspects of the results. We conclude that the principles espoused by Briggs and Cheek (1986) are not only useful but essential in the study of personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

	Abstract = {Introversion/extraversion and neuroticism are 2 important and frequently studied dimensions of human personality. These dimensions describe individual differences in emotional responding across a range of situations and may contribute to a predisposition for psychiatric disorders. Recent neuroimaging research has begun to provide evidence that neuroticism and introversion/extraversion have specific functional and structural neural correlates. Previous studies in healthy adults have reported an association between neuroticism, introversion/extraversion, and the activity of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Studies of individuals with psychopathological states have also indicated that anatomic variations in these brain areas may relate to extraversion and neuroticism. The purpose of the present study was to examine selected structural correlates of neuroticism and extraversion in healthy subjects (n = 28) using neuroanatomic measures of the cerebral cortex and amygdala. We observed that the thickness of specific prefrontal cortex regions correlates with measures of extraversion and neuroticism. In contrast, no such correlations were observed for the volume of the amygdala. The results suggest that specific aspects of regional prefrontal anatomy are associated with specific personality traits.

These factors predicted a global measure of affect, emotional reactions to a laboratory mood induction, and self-reported affect in daily life. 86 college students (mean age 20.51 yrs) completed questionnaires, daily report forms and an experimental session. Generally, reward sensitivity predicted positive emotions, whereas punishment sensitivity predicted negative emotions. Impulsivity-thrill seeking predicted few emotions in either context.

A standard go-no-go discrimination learning task was used in each of the 4 experiments. The results indicate that individual differences in performance of this discrimination are more consistently and strongly associated with impulsivity and anxiety than with extraversion and neuroticism. In each of the experiments, high anxiety hindered the learning of a go-no-go discrimination more among high-impulsive Ss than among low impulsive Ss, and in 2 of the experiments high anxiety actually facilitated learning among low impulsive Ss. These findings are incompatible with H. J. Eysenck's (1967) and J. A. Gray's (1982) hypotheses regarding extraversion but are not inconsistent with the hypotheses of J. P. Newman et al (see record 1985-22847-001). Aspects of these results do support J. T. Spence and K. W. Spence's (1966) and Gray's models of anxiety and instrumental conditioning.

Chapters are devoted to temperament and personality trait structure, psychobiological methods, and each of four major personality traits: extraversion, impulsive, sensation seeking, and aggression. Recent advances in psychobiological methods, such as molecular genetics and brain imaging, have enabled us to begin to unravel the genetic and neurological sources of behavior and personality. These advances are discussed in this new edition, making it essential reading for advanced students of psychology and psychiatry. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

	Abstract = {J. A. Easterbrook's (1959) suggestion that arousal is inversely related to the range of cue utilization is frequently cited as an explanation for the curvilinear relationship between arousal and performance. As a test of this hypothesis, 60 undergraduates who varied in their impulsivity level were given caffeine or placebo and then asked to proofread several passages. It was predicted that high arousal would reduce sensitivity to interword errors, which require a broad range of cue utilization, but that the observed levels of arousal would not affect sensitivity to intraword errors, which require a minimal range of cue utilization. A significant crossover interaction between impulsivity and drug for interword errors indicated that caffeine increased the error detection rate of the less aroused/more impulsive Ss but lowered the error detection rate of the more aroused/less impulsive Ss. Results support the suggestion that arousal directly effects the capacity for simultaneous information processing, independent of its effects on performance speed.

Folkard et al's (see record 1977-04577-001) study of body temperature and performance, 84 undergraduates classified as low or high impulsive were given either caffeine or placebo. Two versions of a visual search task, one with a 2-letter target (a low memory load task) and one with a 6-letter target (a high memory load task), were used. As predicted, caffeine differentially affected the 2 tasks: Ss given caffeine detected a lower proportion of 6-letter targets but a greater proportion of 2-letter targets than did Ss given placebo. An unexpected interaction between Impulsivity, Task Sequence, and Target Size suggested that high and low impulsives may have adopted different strategies or may have experienced different motivational states during the course of the experiment. The relevance of these data to J. A. Easterbrook's (see record 1959-03042-001) explanation of the Yerkes-Dodson effect is also discussed.

To test this hypothesis, 129 Ss differing in impulsivity were given placebo or caffeine at 9:00 AM or 7:30 PM. Recognition memory was tested for the last 20 items from 2 lists of 24 items and 2 lists of 80 items. Scores from this paradigm reflect sustained attention and are thus sensitive to changes in arousal. A 4-way interaction among impulsivity, time of day, drug, and prior stimuli indicated that for those given placebo, recognition memory for long and late lists was poorer the higher the impulsivity in the morning; this pattern reversed in the evening. Caffeine reduced recognition errors. These results indicate that impulsivity is not a stable predictor of rate of change in arousal states. Instead, susceptibility to attentional lapses is mediated by impulsivity-related phase differences in diurnal arousal rhythms.

A realignment of FFM facets to produce separate Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness factors provided better prediction of personality variables that involve deceit without hostility, such as Social Adroitness and Self-Monitoring.

The key to understanding why Michell has made such a statement is bound up in the definition of measurement that characterises quantification of variables within the natural sciences. By describing the key features of quantitative measurement, and contrasting these with current psychometric practice, it is argued that Michell is correct in his assertion. Three avenues of investigation would seem to follow from this position, each of which, it is suggested, will gradually replace current psychometric test theory, principles, and properties. The first attempts to construct variables that can be demonstrated empirically to possess a quantitative structure.

In this article dedicated to "ability testing," it is strange to find no technical definition of what exactly is said to constitute "an ability." Further, the word intelligence is mentioned in passing within the first section of the article entitled "Precursors" and appears in various other places interspersed with the term abilities. Yet, the author ignores dealing with either terminology. Instead, the reader is assumed to know the definition of ability to the degree that measures of it can be discussed and projected into the future. The author makes a strong case that the second century of ablity testing will be built largely on the groundwork of probabilistic Item Response Theory (IRT), computer technology, and item-generation algorithms, not on any kind of reconceptualization of what actually might constitute an ability or intelligence. I think this is far too restricted a view of the impact that fundamental scientific investigation of "mental abilities" might have on ability testing in the future. I purposely took the term ability to refer to a broad psychological construct that is definitional for a range of complex observed phenomena associated with a human cognitive system.

This is a careful, thoughtful, article that quietly proceeds to outline the problems with current thinking and approaches to defining and using constructs in psychology. McGrath also suggests how some of these problems might be addressed. I note that McGrath appears to miss what might be considered an obvious rejoinder to some of his arguments, that is, the use of latent variable and item response theory. Some consideration is given to these arguments. However, a cursory examination shows that although these new methodologies offer many opportunities for new stochastic questionnaire data modeling and the construction of "instant" latent variables, the same problems caused by lack of attention to measurement and meaning remain. I find I am in agreement with many of the author's views and arguments, but I also find myself wondering whether modern psychometrics and individual differences research methods is now so dominated by psychological statisticians that any thought of substantive scientific innovation in this area that deals more properly with measurement and meaning is long gone.

The average cross-situational consistency of trait impressions across the 15 episodes was .43. Shared stereotypes related to gender and age were mostly accurate and contributed little to agreement among judges. Agreement was limited mainly by nonshared meaning systems and by nonoverlapping information. Personality inferences from thin slices of behavior were significantly associated with reports by knowledgeable informants. This association became stronger when more episodes were included, but gains in prediction were low beyond 6 episodes. Inferences of intelligence from thin slices of behavior strongly predicted intelligence test scores. A particularly strong single predictor was how persons read short sentences.

Krueger reported on the analysis of comorbidity data obtained in a sample of 8098 noninstitutionalized US civilians in the National Comorbidity Survey. The analysis was carried out using confirmatory analysis, which yields a 3-factor model that accounts reasonably well for the obtained covariance between several mental disorders. This led Krueger to conclude that "The results offer a novel perspective on comorbidity, suggesting that comorbidity results from common, underlying core psychopathological processes." The current author notes, however, that diagnoses were made using criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) "without the imposition of hierarchical exclusionary rules." It is stated that this is fine as long as correlations among disorders are interpreted as reflecting comorbidity patterns, the problem arises when the obtained correlations are subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis and the resulting factors are interpreted as "underlying core psychopathological processes." It is concluded that Krueger's results cannot be regarded as evidence for such processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Each set of authors analyzes the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for measurement invariance using the same data, albeit with different methods. Together, the articles provide a sort of natural experiment on the robustness of biasing effects with respect to the choice of method. Although the present collection of articles on DIF detection show considerable agreement on the time and direction of biasing effects in the MMSE, some disagreement is also evident. This disagreement is likely due to the use of different empirical criteria for diagnosis of DIF. Evidently, whether bias is to be considered an important validity threat is not a straightforward function of p values or effect sizes. The reason for this is that the importance of bias is partly a pragmatic issue: It depends on aspects of the research situation that are not statistical in nature, such as the purposes for which the test scores are being used. Investigating measurement invariance should now become a routine part of research into the structure of group differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Michell further argues that the hypothesis should be tested using additive conjoint measurement theory. Although relevant to classical test theory, Michell's arguments do not apply to psychometrics in general. In particular, they are largely irrelevant to item response theory models. We show that these models result from introducing probabilistic relations, which are needed to deal with measurement error, and not from a breakdown in critical inquiry, as Michell suggests. Moreover, at least one class of these models can be formulated in terms of additive conjoint measurement theory, which renders Michell's call for the additive conjoint model in need of qualification. Finally, item response theory models are routinely tested against empirical data, and although the assumption that an attribute is quantitative cannot be tested directly, such tests do address the conjunction of this assumption and other model assumptions.

To substantiate intraindividual causal conclusions, one must explicitly represent individual level processes in the measurement model. Several research strategies that may be useful in this respect are discussed, and a typology of constructs is proposed on the basis of this analysis.

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) The focus on individual differences in complex behaviors is familiar to geneticists and personality psychologists, but less so to cognitive neuroscientists, who have traditionally regarded individual differences in their data sets as unwanted statistical noise (Plomin & Kosslyn, 2001). In neuroimaging of cognitive processes, individual differences may reduce statistical reliability. For example, if in a sample of 10 participants 5 showed activation in a certain brain region and 5 did not, what could we conclude? In the absence of any additional information, we would probably have to settle for stating that this region is not reliably activated. But how would the interpretation of the data change if additional information were available? For example, what if the 5 activators all happened to be female, and the 5 nonactivators all happened to be male? In this case, the inclusion of a specific dimension of individual differences (in this case, the sex of the participants) could reveal something about the brain's function ("Women activate, men don't") that otherwise would have been missed. A focus on individual differences in neuroimaging is a relatively recent phenomenon. One of the earliest references comes from a neuroimaging study of language (Steinmetz \& Seitz, 1991), in which the authors drew attention to individual differences in the localization of language. Since then, the publication record has steadily grown: A database search (MEDLINE) of the terms "individual difference" and either "PET" or "fMRI" returned 5 publications from 1990-1994, 11 from 1995-1999, and 57 from 2000-2004.

Recent methodological advances are allowing investigators from diverse disciplines to address these and other important questions with unprecedented precision--yet the resulting findings have largely remained disparate. Filling a crucial gap, this is the first volume to provide an integrative overview of current research using cutting-edge genetic and neuroimaging methods in the study of personality. From leading contributors, the book thoroughly explains the state of the science while highlighting implications for treatment and prevention. Coverage ranges from new discoveries about brain structures and processes to the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety and depression. Compelling topics include: Whether traits such as extraversion can be "seen" in the brain; How men and women differ in their response to stress or sexual arousal; The effects of aging on emotion and memory; Why some individuals are more anxious than others; Neurobiological risk factors for child and adult psychopathology; What animal studies reveal about human personality. Throughout, attention is given to ways in which biological processes interact with environment and experience in shaping individual differences. Most chapters conclude with a section entitled "Looking Forward," in which the contributors discuss key questions that remain unanswered and speculate on the future of their respective fields. Synthesizing important developments in personality psychology; clinical psychology and psychiatry; cognitive, affective, and behavioral neuroscience; and comparative psychology, this is a highly informative reference for researchers and students.

Based on the hypothesis that the neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype can moderate the influence of childhood maltreatment on neural systems implicated in antisocial behavior, the authors tested whether antisocial behavior would be predicted by an interaction between a gene (MAOA) and an environment (maltreatment).

Four outcome measure of antisocial behavior were examined using information from independent sources appropriate to different stages of development. The results find a functional polymorphism in the gene encoding MAOA moderated the effect of maltreatment. Maltreated children with a genotype conferring high levels of MAOA expression were less likely to develop antisocial problems. These findings may partly explain why not all victims of maltreatment grow up to victimize others, and they provide epidemiological evidence that genotypes can moderate children's sensitivity to environmental insults.

The only short test for the number of such factors that has been repeatedly supported by plasmode results is the scree (introduced by the 1st author, 1966). The present experiment extends this empirical testing of the scree by taking 15 plasmodes, which vary in (a) number of variables; (b) number of factors; (c) degree of obliquity, from orthogonal cases on; (d) presence of simple structure; (e) presence of error, extending to factoring random numbers; and (f) size of communality. Results support the scree and show it superior to the Kaiser-Guttman unity root criterion. Apart from the scree itself, a brief examination is made of the reliability of its use in the hands of trained and untrained judges.

The study empirically demonstrated the substantive benefits of ideal point methodology as compared with the dominance framework underlying traditional methods of scale construction. Specifically, using a large, heterogeneous pool of order items, the authors constructed scales using traditional classical test theory, dominance item response theory (IRT), and ideal point IRT methods. The merits of each method were examined in terms of item pool utilization, model-data fit, measurement precision, and construct and criterion-related validity. Results show that adoption of the ideal point approach provided a more flexible platform for creating future personality measures, and this transition did not adversely affect the validity of personality test scores.

Results revealed a distinct antecedent profile for each goal in the trichotomous framework: Mastery goals were linked to the presence of lecture engagement and the absence of an evaluation focus and harsh evaluation, performance-approach goals were linked to the presence of evaluation focus, and performance-avoidance goals were linked to the presence of evaluation focus and harsh evaluation. When the perceived classroom environment and achievement goal variables were tested together as predictors of graded performance and intrinsic motivation, the results clearly demonstrated that the influence of the perceived classroom environment on these outcomes measures was indirect; the perceived classroom environment influenced achievement goal adoption, and achievement goal adoption, in turn, directly influenced graded performance and intrinsic motivation.

This joint subsystems hypothesis was contrasted with the conventional separable subsystems hypothesis of independent effects of the BIS and BAS in 2 paradigms: (1) affective modulation of the acoustic startle reflex (n=70), to measure the induction of emotional state; and (2) a visual information processing task with manipulations of reinforcement and arousal (500 mg caffeine citrate vs placebo; n=120), to measure behavioral inhibition/disinhibition. Consistent with the joint subsystems hypothesis: (1) high anxiety strengthened affective reactions in the presence of unpleasant (compared with neutral) slides, but this effect was stronger in low impulsivity participants; and (b) avoidance of punishment of incorrect responses was poorest in low anxiety, high impulsivity participants, pointing to a disinhibited pattern of reaction in individuals who, putatively, have a weak BIS and a strong BAS.

Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) of personality, and consistent with the general principles of RST, it is hypothesized that the empirical relationship between individual differences in reward sensitivity and actual reactions to (experimenter-defined) reward is moderated by reward expectancies. However, contrary to the specific predictions of RST, it is argued that actual reward of a lower value than expected reward leads to a state of frustrative nonreward primarily in reward sensitive (e.g. impulsive) individuals (it may, as a secondary effect, be enhanced in punishment sensitive, anxious individuals); in contrast, RST contents that frustrative nonreward is mediated primarily by punishment sensitivity (anxiety), and is unrelated to reward sensitivity (e.g. impulsivity). Frustrative nonreward can produce complex, and difficult to interpret, personality x reward effects in typical human laboratory experiments; such results often appear in opposition to the theoretical foundations of RST. It is argued that closer attention to the operational definitions of (experimenter-defined) reward, as well as participants' reward expectancies, may lead to greater experimental precision in RST studies.

Broad measures of personality (extraversion, E; neuroticism, N; and psychoticism, P) and specific measures of trait anxiety (Anx) and impulsivity (Imp) were taken. Punishment led to response invigoration, reducing reaction time latency, but this was not related to personality. A negative correlation of P and learning was observed in both punishment and control conditions. In support of Gray's theory, high Anx improved learning under punishment (and impaired learning under control), and low Anx improved learning under control (and impaired learning under punishment).

His arguments are clearly articulated, strongly supported, and quite timely, particularly given the recent surge in popularity of longitudinal studies of individual developmental trajectories. The reviewers' do not perceive their current set of interindividual variation (IEV) methodologies to be as limited as Molenaar seems to imply. More specifically, Molenaar makes the argument that (a) scientific psychology is almost exclusively based on statistical methods designed for the study of IEV, (b) individual development is defined by processes that are inherently characterized by intraindividual variation (IAV), ergo (c) IEV statistical methods cannot be validly applied to the study of individual development. A core concept of any empirical science is the distinction between internal and external validity. The reviewers believe the distinction between internal and external validity plays a key role in considering the IEV and IAV distinction articulated by Molenaar. More specifically, they believe that Molenaar focused almost exclusively on issues of internal validity without equal consideration to associated implications for external validity. The reviewers thank Molenaar for providing such an insightful and well-articulated call for the permanent return of the individual to scientific psychology.

Individual differences in personality traits thereby reflect variation in the sensitivity to such stimuli, and, overall, personality represents the relative strength of sensitivities to various stimulus classes.

Indeed, studies examining relations between eating disorders and attention to body and/or shape related stimuli have found such associations. Although this research is invaluable in characterizing relations between attentional processes and eating disordered attitudes, such work remains correlational in nature. In the present investigation, 73 undergraduate women were randomly assigned to one of two attentional training conditions. One condition trained attention away from body/shape words, whereas the other trained attention toward body/shape words. Following this training participants reported on their eating-related attitudes. Women trained to avoid body/shape words subsequently reported more concerns about eating and body shape. These results suggest that attentional avoidance of body/shape concerns increases such concerns. The results point to the potential causal effects of attention on eating disordered attitudes, in turn suggesting a basis for possible treatment.

	Abstract = {(from the cover) Applies the principles of modern learning theory to account for the observed phenomena of hysteria and anxiety. Such principles were initially developed through the experiments and theories of Pavlov, Hull, and Tolman. When The Dynamics of Anxiety and Hysteria initially appeared, these were considered the most advanced, relevant, and applicable to the subject matter. They have not been superseded by later work. The Dynamics of Anxiety and Hysteria has never been published in the United States. It was the fifth book Eysenck authored as part of a series of experimental studies and theoretical work carried out under the auspices of the Institute of Psychiatry at the University of London. Two of the first four books--Dimensions of Personality and The Psychology of Politics--have been reissued with new introductions. These focus on dimensional analysis of personality based on experimental and empirical studies.

This volume, which complements other new editions of Eysenck's work, will be of lasting significance to psychologists, psychiatrists, behavioralists, and students of personality disorders.

One important cause was suggested by Lee Cronbach in his 1957 presidential address to the American Psychological Association: the continuing failure of the two scientific disciplines of psychology--the experimental and the correlational--to come together and mutually support each other. Personality study in particular has suffered from this disunity, and the debates about the number of major dimensions of personality. Examples are given to show that by combining methods and theories typical of these two disciplines, one can be put forward paradigms that would be impossible without such unification. Such a paradigm is suggested for personality and intelligence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

There was considerable agreement between the multidimensional scaling and factor analyses, and the results for men and women. Some scales did not relate to P, E, or N, and were outside the field covered by the 3 superfactors. On the whole, the scales behaved very much as predicted by theory, and the relative standing of men and women on the scales was also as predicted, i.e., women were higher on N scales, men on P scales.

Anxiety will always reduce processing effectiveness, but will not impair performance efficiency if there is sufficient effort expenditure.

Objections against the empirical method are refuted although it is admitted that the feeling of the artist may be the best way to find the most beautiful solution. The major part of the article reports the empirical proof on the pleasantness of proportions based on the selections among 10 different quadrangles (proportions from 1:1 to 5:2). The peak of pleasingness was found with the golden section rectangle (35%), based on the choices of 347 Ss (aged 16 yrs and older). Data on preference for and rejection of rectangles, as well as details of Ss' reactions are reported. Musically defined proportions did not show any superiority over other kinds of proportion. The preference for the golden section, however, was not found in a task of dividing a vertical line. It is concluded that the importance of the golden section has been overemphasized.

With respect to trends (e.g., a person's typical way of acting), however, the person side of the debate is right: Traits predict and describe behavior very well over long stretches of time, behavior is highly stable, and a trait approach is needed to explain differences between people. Thus, proponents of both sides are right and should continue to conduct fruitful research, and both viewpoints are necessary for a full understanding of personality.

Study 3's experimental methodology replicated the relationship when extraversion was manipulated within a fixed situation. Thus, the relationship between extraversion and positive affect, previously demonstrated between persons, also characterizes the internal, ongoing psychological functioning of individuals and is likely to be explained by something capable of rapid intraindividual variation. Furthermore, traits and states are at least somewhat isomorphic, and acting extraverted may increase well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Even more surprising is that there are few contenders for this title, and this question seems not to have been raised before. This article traces some of the developments in the history of this graphical method, the origin of the term scatterplot, the role it has played in the history of science, and some of its modern descendants. We suggest that the origin of this method can be traced to its unique advantage: the possibility to discover regularity in empirical data by smoothing and other graphic annotations to enhance visual perception.

	Abstract = {(from the chapter) Organizational psychology is the study of how individuals are recruited, selected and socialized into organizations; how they are rewarded and motivated; how organizations are structured formally and informally into groups, sections and teams; and how leaders emerge and behave. It also examines how the organization influences the thoughts, feelings and behaviour of all employees by the actual, imagined or implied behaviour of others in their organization. Organizational psychology is the study of the individual in the organization, but it is also concerned with small and large groups and the organization as a whole as it impacts on the individual. Organizational psychology is a relatively young science. Like cognitive science, it is a hybrid discipline that is happy to break down disciplinary boundaries. From a psychological perspective, the major branches of the discipline to have influenced organizational psychology are experimental, differential, engineering and social psychology. This updated textbook is comprehensive in its coverage of organizational psychology. The contents cover the following broad categories: the history of organizational psychology and the study of work psychology; vocational choice; organizational selection and socialization; personality and individual differences; work-related attitudes, values and perceptions; work motivation and satisfaction; stress at work; cooperation, power and ethical behaviour in organizations; learning and training at work; group dynamics; decision-making; leadership; culture at work; organizational structure, change and development; working abroad; and the future of work.

From these two data, the median strength can be determined by the simple method spoken of above, an d not only it but also the distribution of strength among the people. "},

	Abstract = {Units of personality may be of 2 varieties: dimensional variables (traits), which involve continuously distributed differences in degree, and class variables, which involve discretely distributed differences in kind. There exists, however, a prevailing assumption that the units of personality are continuous dimensions and an accompanying prejudice against class variables. Thus, differences between people are presumed to be differences in degree, not kind. The authors examine this prejudice, the arguments that generated it, and those that uphold it. It is concluded that these arguments are applicable to class variables as they often have been explicated, in phenetic terms; by contrast, genetically explicated class variables are not vulnerable to these arguments. Criteria are proposed and methods are presented for corroborating the existence of class variables in personality. A test is described of a class model of a construct, the conceptual status of which makes it reasonable to evaluate whether or not the differences between individuals represented by this construct constitute discrete classes. Self-monitoring is demonstrated to be a discretely distributed class variable that influences social behavior. Implications for conceptualizing and investigating the nature and origins of personality are examined. (31/2 p ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Mathematical representations of such clinical judges can often be constructed to capture critical aspects of their judgmental strategies. An analysis of the characteristics of such models permits a specification of the conditions under which the model itself will be a more valid predictor than will the man from whom it was derived. To ascertain whether such conditions are met in natural clinical decision making, data were reanalyzed from P. E. Meehl's (see 34:3) study of the judgments of 29 clinical psychologists attempting to differentiate psychotic from neurotic patients on the basis of their MMPI profiles. Results of these analyses indicate that for this diagnostic task models of the men are generally more valid than the men themselves. Moreover, the finding occurred even when the models were constructed on a small set of cases, and then man and model competed on a completely new set. (29 ref.)

Average cross-validities of each inventory were compared across 13 criterion indices, and across the 7 most predictable criteria, for each of 14 types of prediction functions and for differing numbers of predictors included in each function. Results were compared with orthogonal components and factors nonlinear and configural prediction models, other sets of CPI scales, and empirical item selection tactics. These analyses suggest that while the inventories constructed by the 3 major strategies produced quite similar average cross-validities, there was a sizable Criteria * Strategies interaction effect. Specifically, the external strategy appeared to produce a broader band-width but lower fidelity inventory than did the internal or intuitive strategies. Results were not limited to analyses using any particular number of scales in the prediction functions, nor to analyses based upon the traditional multiple-regression paradigm. However, a subset of 5 rational scales provided average cross-validities at least as high as those produced by the other strategies and tactics under study. (80 ref.)

Moreover, a predictor index initially developed on individual profiles produced a cross-validity coefficient of .83 when applied to the group profiles. Findings suggest that group data appear to contain such a high signal to noise ratio that they become extraordinarily efficient indicators of underlying processes processes which are normally obscured by the unreliability inherent in individual profiles.

In a single design, parallel procedures and instruments were used in 2 species, dogs (Canis familiaris) and humans (Homo sapiens), to test whether personality differences exist and can be judged in dogs as accurately as in humans. Personality judgments of humans and dogs were compared on 3 accuracy criteria: internal consistency, consensus, and correspondence. Results showed that, on all 3 criteria, judgments of dogs were as accurate as judgments of humans. These findings are consistent with the evolutionary continuity hypothesis and suggest an important conclusion not widely considered by either personality or animal researchers: Personality differences do exist and can be measured in animals other than humans.

Hunt and Carlson are to be commended not only for standing up for the legitimacy of such research but also for reporting basic facts on the science that others outside the field often deny or distort. Among the much-replicated empirical findings that the authors mention in their article are that IQ tests measure a general learning ability, predict many kinds of life success to some degree, measure cognitive ability equally well among American Blacks and Whites, and predict academic achievement equally well in both groups. The authors also mention that social environments are not just external but have both genetic and environmental components and that race exists as a biological entity or continuum. Such conclusions are mainstream among specialists on human variation in intelligence. The authors own misstatements illustrate how small but consistent error can reinforce the prevailing public misperceptions that the intelligence-research community is still in a muddle about what intelligence is and that it lacks due diligence in looking for test bias and shrinking IQ gaps. Three of these examples are mistaken criticisms of core intelligence research, the fourth reflects uncritical acceptance of others' false claims against it, and the fifth is a conceptual error resulting in false praise for an unwarranted claim against IQ tests.

In Personality and the Fate of Organizations, author Robert Hogan offers a systematic account of the nature of personality, showing how to use personality to understand, evaluate, select, deselect, train, and understand organizations. This book brings insights from a leading industrial organizational psychologist who asserts that personality is real, and that it determines the careers of individuals and the fate of organizations. The author's goal is to increase the reader's ability to understand other people--how they are alike, how they are different, and why they do what they do. Armed with understanding, readers will be able to pursue their personal, social, and organizational goals more efficiently. A practical reference, this book is extremely useful for MBA students and for all those studying organizational psychology and leadership.

Analyses with some examples suggest that if the alpha-level for the Bartlett test is set (explicitly) in the neighborhood of .0003 for sample Ns of 100-250, the results from applications of this test will indicate approximately the same number of factors as estimated on the basis of a scree test determined on approximately 600 Ss. Used in this way, the Bartlett test may yield fairly good "population" estimates of the number of factors. Relationships between the Bartlett test, hence the scree test, and tests for a common factor model and for the significance of a correlation matrix are explicated.

Chapter 3 summarizes relevant data about three major scholastic and industrial testing programs--the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, and the General Aptitude Test Battery--that predict performance in three important workplaces. Two intelligence tests are also examined. Chapter 4 combines two fields, psychometrics and demographics, to examine how current demographic trends and social policies may alter the distribution of cognitive skills across the work force in the next 10-15 years. Chapter 5 proposes that theories in cognitive psychology have the potential for explaining how superior thinking ability translates into workplace performance. Chapter 6 forecasts the cognitive demands that the early 21st-century workplace will present to its workers.

In this article we will be concerned primarily with racial differences but will make remarks about gender differences where applicable. Previously there have been bitter arguments over whether or not races exist, over whether it is either important or proper to study racial and gender differences in intelligence, and over the conclusions that have been drawn about environmental and genetic causes as determinants of these differences. We argue that races do, indeed, exist and that studying differences in cognitive competence between groups is a reasonable thing to do. We also point out that past research on both racial and gender differences in intelligence has been marked by methodological errors and overgeneralizations by researchers on all sides of the issue.

It is well known that with Student's two-independent-sample t test, the actual level of significance can be well above or below the nominal level, confidence intervals can have inaccurate probability coverage, and power can be low relative to other methods. A solution to deal with heterogeneity is Welch's (1938) test. Welch's test deals with heteroscedasticity but can have poor power under arbitrarily small departures from normality. Yuen (1974) generalized Welch's test to trimmed means; her method provides improved control over the probability of a Type I error, but problems remain. Transformations for skewness improve matters, but the probability of a Type I error remains unsatisfactory in some situations. We find that a transformation for skewness combined with a bootstrap method improves Type I error control and probability coverage even if sample sizes are small.

The idea is that specific mental disorders described in DSM may be conceived of as facets of broad, underlying dimensions of psychopathological variation. The goal of the research is to detect the signatures of these dimensions by examining patterns of correlations among DSM-derived diagnostic variables. Findings from two samples--the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study and the National Comorbidity Survey--are subjected to confirmatory factor analysis as applied to tetrachoric correlations among DSM-defined mental disorder diagnoses derived from structured interviews. Results of the analyses suggest that internalizing and externalizing are replicable phenotypic dimensions undergirding patterns of correlations among common mental disorders.

In a clinical subsample of the nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey participants (N=251), a one-factor model fit the correlations among 7 dichotomous anxiety and unipolar mood diagnoses. Following the lead provided by literature on the structure of emotional and behavioral problems in children, we labeled this factor internalizing. Item response theory was used to explore how each diagnosis mapped onto the internalizing factor. The test information function derived from the 7 diagnoses suggested that they measure primarily the higher end of the factor. In addition, very high scores on internalizing (meeting criteria for 6-7 disorders) were associated with increased social costs, a phenomenon not well captured by the "comorbidity" concept. The results underscore the need to develop clinical assessment instruments that span the full range of the internalizing factor and measure both the shared and distinctive features of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders in a graded, continuous fashion.

Sarason's (see PA, Vol 27:2743) attentional theory, and M. W. Eysenck's (1979) working memory capacity theory, were compared for their efficacy in explaining anxiety-induced performance decrements on a task of analogical reasoning. 102 undergraduates who varied in their trait and state anxiety levels completed 100 geometric analogies under either relaxed (reassurance, non-time-limited) or stress (ego-threat, time-limited) conditions. Response time and error rate data for 9 levels of task complexity (1-, 2-, and 3-element analogies with 0, 1, or 2 transformations for each element) were analyzed by means of multivariate analysis of variance. Results in the relaxed condition support attentional theory in that more anxious Ss were both slower and less accurate than were less anxious Ss. In the stressed condition, none of the 3 anxiety-performance theories was supported. More anxious Ss were faster but made more errors than did less anxious Ss. Thus, in the stressed condition, performance differences suggested differences in speed-accuracy trade-off strategies rather than differences in processing abilities. The limitations of attentional theory and the need to study the effects of anxiety and time stress on information processing are discussed.

Eysenck's theory concerns the extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism traits, whereas Gray proposed the use of the rotated axes of impulsivity and anxiety. Eysenck used multiple arousal systems as central explanatory constructs, whereas Gray describes more specific systems related to behavioral inhibition and activation. The authors review evidence relating to these theories and discuss key predictive successes and failures and methodological problems. There is a core of support for the Eysenck theory in some paradigms, such as the moderator effect of stimulation level on individual differences in phasic electrodermal response and eyelid conditioning. In other settings, the theory fails to explain empirical data adequately, especially in studies of subjective response and attention and performance. Gray's theory has advanced research through stimulating interest in moderation of personality effects by motivational variables and provides a better explanation than Eysenck's theory for certain data, such as instrumental conditioning to reward stimuli and the positive affectivity of extraverts. Overall, however, Gray's theory explains a narrower ranges of findings than Eysenck's. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Assessment of traits is useful for understanding the individual client, for diagnosis and therapy, and for tailoring the clinical interview to the needs of the patient. Dimensional models have been applied to several areas of pathology. Neuroticism and a variety of other traits are implicated in subclinical stress reactions. At the process level, the effects of traits such as neuroticism may be mediated by maladaptive coping strategies. Traits such as neuroticism may also have a causal effect on more severe mood and anxiety disorders, although it is likely that there are reciprocal linkages between personality and pathology. As with subclinical stress, traits may influence depression and anxiety through abnormality of cognitive processes, the clinical significance of which should be assessed in the light of the individual's trait characteristics. A further area of application is personality disorder: Dimensional models capture and clarify the principal clinical features of conditions such as schizoid and antisocial disorders. It is concluded that the dimensional approach provides a framework for the systematic understanding of clinical expressions of abnormality in personality and their implications for diagnosis and treatment.

For example, negative words are evaluated faster if they are presented in a low versus high vertical position. The present studies extended this view by investigating whether such biases also correlate with individual differences in emotional experience. Specifically, in two studies, we examined whether vertical metaphor would be useful in understanding negative affect as manifested in neuroticism and depressive symptoms. We found support for this premise. That is, the higher the neuroticism (Studies 1 and 2) or depressive symptoms (Study 2) of participants, the faster they were to respond to or detect lower (versus higher) spatial attention targets. These results suggest that negative affect in general, and depressive symptoms in particular, appear to bias selective attention in a direction that favors lower regions of physical space.

In a series of three studies, participants categorized words as negative or positive. The valence of the words and the brightness of the letters were varied orthogonally. In Studies 1, 2, and 3, we found that categorization was inhibited when there was a mismatch between stimulus brightness (e.g., light) and word valence (e.g., negative).

Although at least one study has partially supported this idea, the implicit cognitive reactivity to gay images has not been examined. We conducted the current study to investigate such cognitive forms of reactivity with the intent to better understand defensive homophobia. Participants completed two implicit sexual interest tasks in addition to questionnaires of self-deception and homophobia. We found that self-deception moderated the relationship between homophobia and performance within the implicit tasks. Contrary to the idea that defensive homophobics (i.e., homophobics high in self-deception) harbor an implicit attraction for gay sex, we found that such individuals displayed evidence of a phobic-like aversion. We also identified a non-defensive form of homophobia (i.e., homophobics low in self-deception) that was relatively inconsequential for performance within the implicit cognitive tasks related to gay sex. The results suggest that defensive homophobics have an implicit aversion rather than an implicit attraction to gay sexual stimuli.

However, not everyone engages in an aggressive act after being exposed to an aggression-related cue. Some thought pattern, perhaps an automatic one, may prevent the cue-aggression sequence in some individuals. These considerations motivated the present research, which examined the potential for agreeableness to moderate the effect of aggression-related cues on behavior and cognition. In Study 1, we found that priming with aggression-related cues increased aggressive behavior, but only among individuals low in agreeableness. Study 2 showed that aggression-related cues activated prosocial thoughts among individuals high in agreeable affect (a component of agreeableness). These results reveal that agreeable individuals are able to short-circuit the cue-aggression sequence, likely by recruiting prosocial thoughts in response to aggression-related primes.

The widespread acceptance of this definition within psychology made this neglect systemic, with the consequence that the implications of contemporary research in measurement theory for undertaking the scientific task are not appreciated.

The central concept in measurement theory is that of a continuous quantitative attribute and explaining what measurement is requires showing how this central concept leads on to those of ratio and real number and distinguishing measurements from measures. These distinctions made, the logic of quantification is described with particular emphasis upon the scientific task of quantification, as opposed to the instrumental task. The position presented is that measurement is the estimation of the magnitude of a quantitative attribute relative to a unit and that quantification is always contingent upon first attempting the scientific task of acquiring evidence that the relevant attribute is quantitative in structure. This position means that the definition of measurement usually given in psychology is incorrect and that psychologists' claims about being able to already measure psychological attributes must be seriously questioned. Just how the scientific task of investigating whether psychological attributes are quantitative may be undertaken in psychology is then considered and the corollary that psychological attributes may not actually be quantitative is raised.

On the basis of this imperative, qualitative research methods are still excluded from mainstream psychology. Where does this view come from? Many qualitative researchers think it is an expression of positivism. Is this attribution correct? Then again qualitative researchers often confuse positivism with naive realism. What is the relationship between the quantitative imperative and naive realism? In this paper, it is shown that in finding opposition, qualitative researchers did not, as they sometimes allege, come up against the hard, positivistic edge of science. They encountered something at once much more deep-seated than positivism but also something much less hardheaded than they suppose positivism to have been. Indeed, perhaps surprisingly, positivism is no barrier to qualitative methods. As for naive realism, it provides a firm foundation for qualitative methods in psychology. It is argued that in psychology, the quantitative imperative is an egregious, potentially self-perpetuating form of methodological error.

A GxE occurs when the effect of exposure to an environmental pathogen on health is conditional on a person's genotype (or conversely, when environmental experience moderates genes' effects on health). Gene-environment interactions were thought to be rare in psychiatry, but empirical findings of measured GxEs are now emerging. However, the current high level of curiosity about GxE is accompanied by uncertainty about the feasibility of GxE research and by pragmatic questions about how to carry out good GxE studies. First, we summarize emerging evidence about GxE in psychiatric disorders. Second, we describe 7 strategic steps that may be used to organize further hypothesis-driven studies of GxE. Third, we explain the potential benefits of the measured-GxE approach for basic neuroscience and for gene hunting.

In the 1st 2 experiments Ss were asked to respond to an auditorily presented name of a letter while looking at a visual stimulus that consisted of a large character (the global level) made out of small characters (the local level). Ss' auditory discrimination responses were subject to interference only by the global level and not by the local one. In Exp III Ss were presented with large characters made out of small ones, and they had to recognize either just the large characters or just the small ones. Whereas the identity of the small characters had no effect on recognition of the large ones, global cues which conflicted with the local ones did inhibit the responses to the local level. In Exp IV Ss were asked to judge whether pairs of simple patterns of geometrical forms which were presented for a brief duration were the same or different. The patterns within a pair could differ either at the global or at the local level. It was found that global differences were detected more often than local differences.

This paper criticizes SI on a number of grounds including: 1) no demonstration of the central historical claim, that is, that the more successful sciences actually have utilized this method more frequently than the less successful sciences; 2) poor historiography, in that more faithful explications of some of the historical case studies Platt cites as canonical examples of SI fail to support that SI was actually used in any of these cases; 3) failure to identify other cases of important scientific progress that did not use SI and instead used distinct scientific methods; 4) neglect of the importance and implications of background knowledge used in problem formulation; 5) the impossibility of enumerating a complete set of alternative hypotheses; 6) no acknowledgement of the Quine-Duhem thesis indicating that "critical" experiments are actually logically inconclusive; 7) the assumption that there is one scientific method; and 8) significant ambiguity regarding exactly how each of the four steps of SI is to be faithfully implemented.

Measuring and conceptualizing "social intelligence" has been difficult, however. Although the idea of social intelligence has a long history, most tests which have been proposed to measure such ability correlate highly with tests of verbal aptitude. The present study describes 6 factors of "behavioral cognition" or social intelligence suggested by Guilford's "structure of intellect" model. These social intelligence factors are defined by 23 tests using photographs, cartoons and other drawn materials, and tape-recorded sounds. The 6 behavioral-cognition factors are shown to be distinct from factors defined by 24 tests of verbal aptitude, spatial ability, and creative thinking. The 18 reference and experimental factors hypothesized and demonstrated are described and discussed. To date no similar factors, reflecting the abilities involved in understanding the feelings and intentions of others, have been reported.

In brief, a good measure of personality is one that possesses strong evidence of construct validity for the intended assessment purpose.

Meehl's (1955) original formulation of the centrality of construct validity issues in the interpretation and evaluation of assessment outcomes. The four principles proposed are: measurement content; internal structure of items in a measure should match the requirements of both the relevant psychological theory and the measurement model; demonstrably high validity for the most theoretically relevant inferences; and the implicative relations of the measure are well explored.

Do persons high in agreeableness have more satisfying romantic relationships? Do those high in conscientiousness perform better at work? If such relations are thought to exist, one might ask the effect size question: What is the magnitude of the relationship between two variables (or groups of variables)? Questions of this kind are fundamental in personality research. Indeed, with the exception of univariate descriptive statistics and the statistical methods associated with hypothesis testing, most other quantitative methods used in personality research can be understood in the context of effect size estimation. Differences between means, correlation coefficients, regression coefficients, and the parameters of structural equation models are all example of effect size estimates. This chapter provides an account of effect size statistics as they are used in personality research. The primary focus is on the interpretation of these statistics, with estimation discussed only (and especially) insofar as interpretation depends on understanding how the effect size statistic has been generated.

	Abstract = {Within the debate on the structure of affect, a consensus began emerging in the last decade regarding the bipolarity of happiness-sadness. We argue that this consensus is premature. Focusing on the psychometrics of momentary affect, particularly happiness and sadness, and using a simulation study, a large-scale data set, and 2 experiments manipulating affect, we plot a map of affective space that departs from the consensus. One key departure is the finding that happiness and sadness are not bipolar opposites. Another is that nonuniform skewness plays a major role in studies of affective structure, but can be addressed with appropriate analyses.

Recent work has highlighted situations that sometimes lead to mixed positive-negative affect. Focusing on the counterpart to these situational factors, the authors explore the individual-difference tendency toward mixed emotions, which they term affective synchrony. In five studies, the authors show that some individuals demonstrate affective synchrony (overlapping experience of positive and negative moods), others a-synchrony (positive and negative mood that fluctuate independently), and still others de-synchrony (positive and negative moods that function as bipolar opposites). These tendencies are stable over time within persons, vary broadly across individuals, and are associated with individual differences in cognitive representation of self and of emotions.

	Abstract = {Describes a method of obtaining an average reaction time (RT) distribution for a group of Ss. The method is particularly useful for cases in which data from many Ss are available but there are only 10-20 RT observations per S cell. Essentially, RTs for each S are organized in ascending order, and quantiles are calculated. The quantiles are then averaged over Ss to give group quantiles (Vincent learning curves). From the group quantiles, a group RT distribution can be constructed. It is shown that this method of averaging is exact for certain distributions (i.e., the resulting distribution belongs to the same family as the individual distributions). Furthermore, Monte Carlo studies and application of the method to the combined data from 3 large experiments provide evidence that properties derived from the group RT distribution are much the same as average properties derived from the data of individual Ss. This article also examines how to quantitatively describe the shape of RT distributions. The use of moments and cumulants as sources of information about distribution shape is evaluated and rejected because of extreme dependence on long, outlier reaction times. As an alternative, the use of explicit distribution functions as approximations to RT distributions is considered. (28 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

Item response theory procedures were used to evaluate differential item functioning (DIF) within each of the 6 facets. The structural modeling results indicate that the Neuroticism scale is weakly invariant, but the hypothesis of strong invariance was not supported. Although several items displayed significant DIF, it was difficult to associate DIF with specific aspects of item content. Also, even when substantial item-level DIF was identified on the Anxiety facet, its effect when considered at the facet level appeared inconsequential. This latter finding illustrates that item-level DIF does not necessarily make a difference when a scale is considered as a whole. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes.

This volume includes overviews of classic topics as well as more recent innovations. Each chapter provides a general introduction to a particular method and then explains, in a step-by-step manner, how the method can be used to address common research questions in the study of personality. The book is divided into three sections. The first section covers the various research designs used in the field, and helps readers determine the optimal type of study for addressing their particular research questions. The second section focuses on methods for assessing or measuring personality; chapters cover all of the most common methods used by personality researchers, as well as more recent but as yet less widely used methods. The third section covers the variety of procedures personality researchers use to analyze and interpret personality data; the chapters in this section help readers determine what to do with their data after they have conducted a personality study. This section also includes several chapters that address some methodological debates and challenges that are relevant to researchers in personality psychology and related fields.

We sought to validate this insight by examining relations between negative affectivity and implicit evaluations of the self. In two studies involving 104 undergraduates, neuroticism correlated significantly with both explicit and implicit self-esteem, despite the lack of correlation among the latter measures. In addition, we found that implicit self-esteem predicted experimenter-reported (Study 1) and informant-reported (Study 2) negative affect. Our findings converge on two ideas, namely: (1) that neuroticism is associated with both conscious and non-conscious evaluations of the self; and (2) that implicit self-esteem shares an intimate relation with negative affectivity, whether self-reported or observer-reported. Such results validate clinical insights concerning neuroticism as well as further the case that implicit self-esteem has implications for one's experience and display of negative affect.

	Abstract = {It is common to think that threat categorisation tendencies (TCTs) should undermine a person's subjective well-being. However, recent research has suggested that the hedonic impact of such tendencies varies considerably according to a person's traits. The present research seeks to extend such a perspective by considering potential interactions between TCTs and the trait of agreeableness. TCTs were measured through the use of choice reaction time tasks contrasting the threat and non-threat categories. As expected, TCTs were not correlated with the trait of agreeableness, but interacted with this trait in predicting the dependent measures. Within three studies involving 184 undergraduates, TCTs were associated with the higher levels of approach-related behaviour and positive emotion among disagreeable individuals, but lower levels of these same variables among agreeable individuals. The authors suggest that threat categorisation tendencies psychologically protect or burden the individual, depending on the levels of agreeableness.

In a series of three studies involving 236 undergraduates, the authors found that introverts who were skilled at categorizing events as threatening (vs. introverts slow to do so) experienced more negative affect in their daily lives. Among extraverts, threat categorization performance did not predict negative affect. The authors suggest that implicit threat categorizations render individuals vulnerable to negative affect but that high levels of Extraversion are capable of inhibiting such affective consequences.

The authors borrow from this self-as-container spatial metaphor to suggest that individual differences in implicit self-esteem, based on a spatial compatibility task, should predict somatic symptoms such as muscle soreness, headaches, and breathing difficulties. Specifically, lower levels of implicit self-esteem, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, should predict a higher frequency and intensity of somatic symptoms. This prediction was investigated in two studies involving a total of 157 undergraduate participants. As predicted, correlations between implicit self-esteem and somatic complaints were robust and negative in direction, as measured by a questionnaire designed to tap anxious arousal (Study 2), momentary (Study 1) and daily (Study 2) reports of somatic symptoms, and informant reports (Study 2). The findings are consistent with spatial metaphor in suggesting that lower levels of implicit self-esteem are associated with tendencies to internalize negative evaluations, in turn biasing bodily symptom perception.

	Abstract = {Seven studies involving 146 undergraduates examined the effects of stimulus valence and arousal on direct and indirect measures of evaluative processing. Stimuli were emotional slides (Studies 1 to 6) or words (Study 7) that systematically varied in valence and arousal. Evaluative categorization was measured by reaction times to evaluate the stimuli (Studies 2, 3, and 7), latencies related to emotional feelings (Study 3), and incidental effects on motor performance (Studies 4 and 5). A consistent interaction was observed such that evaluation latencies were faster if a negative stimulus was high in arousal or if a positive stimulus was low in arousal. Studies 1, 6, and 7 establish that the findings are not due to stimulus identification processes. The findings therefore suggest that people make evaluative inferences on the basis of stimulus arousal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {Clinical views of neuroticism-linked distress often make reference to the perseverative sorts of mental processes that reinforce such experiences. The goal of the present 7 studies, involving 488 undergraduate participants, was to directly examine such perseverative processes. Individual differences in response perseveration were operationalized in terms of choice reaction time difficulties switching (vs. repeating) responses across consecutive trials. Response perseveration interacted with neuroticism in predicting negative emotion, dissatisfaction with life, and displays of negative emotion (Studies 1-4). Specifically, neuroticism-outcome relations were quite a bit stronger at high levels of perseveration. Additional studies (Studies 5-7) provided support for the convergent and discriminant validity of response perseveration. Overall, the results highlight the manner in which response perseveration reinforces experiences of negative emotion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {The authors hypothesized that a greater degree of stimulus- response variability could either serve adaptive or maladaptive control purposes, depending on levels of Neuroticism. Specifically, a more variable relation between stimulus and response may be emotionally beneficial if such flexibility is used to support non-neurotic forms of self-regulation, but costly if it is used to support neurotic forms of self-regulation. To investigate these ideas, the authors asked 232 college undergraduates within three studies to perform several choice reaction time (RT) tasks. On the basis of performance, we could quantify stimulus-response variability in terms of RT variability from trial to trial. Such a measure of stimulus-response variability interacted with Neuroticism in predicting momentary negative affect (Study 1), informant judgments of negative affect (Study 2), and informant judgments of anxious symptoms (Study 3). As hypothesized, greater stimulus-response variability tended to be associated with less distress among individuals low in Neuroticism, but more distress among individuals high in Neuroticism. The results highlight the manner in which Neuroticism may 'taint' control functions, in turn reinforcing Neuroticism-linked outcomes.

The simplest contrasts consist of comparisons of two samples (e.g., based on the independent t statistic). Useful effect-size indices in this situation are members of the g family (e.g., Hedges"s g and Cohen"s d) and the Pearson r. Expressions for calculating these measures and for transforming them back and forth, and describe how to adjust formulas for obtaining g or d from t, or r from g, when the sample sizes are unequal are reviewed. The real-life implications of d or g calculated from t become problematic when there are more than two groups, but the correlational approach is adaptable and interpretable, although more complex than in the case of two groups. A family of four conceptually related correlation indices is described: the alerting correlation, the contrast correlation, the effect-size correlation, and the BESD (binomial effect-size display) correlation. These last three correlations are identical in the simple setting of only two groups, but differ when there are more than two groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

In science, viable, alternative hypotheses are ideally given equal Bayesian prior weights; but this has not been true in the study of racial differences. This article advocates testing environmental and genetic hypotheses of racial differences as competing hypotheses. Two methods are described: (a) fitting means within structural equation models and (b) predicting means of interracial children. These methods have limitations that call for improved research designs of racial differences. One improvement capitalizes on biotechnology. Genetic admixture estimates--the percentage of genes of European origin that a Black individual possesses (independent of genes related to skin coloration)--can represent genetic influences. The study of interracial children can be improved by increasing sample size and by choosing family members who are most informative for a research question. Eventually, individual-admixture estimates will be replaced by molecular genetic tests of alleles of those genes that influence traits.

Second, we evaluate recent clarifications relating to interdependent effects that these systems may have on behavior, in addition to or in place of separable effects (e.g., Corr, 2001; Pickering, 1997). Finally, we consider ambiguities regarding the exact trait dimension to which Gray's "reward system" corresponds. From this review, we suggest that future work is needed to distinguish psychometric measures of (a) fear from anxiety and (b) reward-reactivity from trait impulsivity. We also suggest, on the basis of interdependent system views of RST and associated exploration using formal models, that traits that are based upon RST are likely to have substantial intercorrelations. Finally, we advise that more substantive work is required to define relevant constructs and behaviors in RST before we can be confident in our psychometric measures of them.},

A major aim of the GOSAT lies in the utilization of different modes of measurement, (i.e., peer reports and observational data), in addition to self-reports which have been used predominantly in past behavioral genetic research on personality and temperament in adults. Participants completed a full day assessment at the University of Bielefeld including videotaped social interactions and presentations, psychometric intelligence tests and computerized elementary cognitive tasks as well as objective measures and unobtrusive behavior counts. The research design of the GOSAT was devised to reduce the potential impact of systematic rater bias on estimates of genetic and environmental influences to a minimum. In combination with extensive self-and peer report data on key personality and personality related dimensions available from the BiLSAT, the GOSAT provides a rich dataset, which currently includes DNA samples from 80% of its participants.

The second aim was to examine the genetic and environmental influences on parenting behaviors. The third aim was to examine the extent to which the association between personality and parenting was mediated by genetic and environmental factors. Personality (Five Factor Model, NEO-FFI) and parenting data were collected as part of a larger German study of 300 adult twin pairs (GOSAT). The current paper analyzes data on a subset of the 300 twin pairs from the GOSAT sample who were concordant for having children (n = 98 pairs or 196 individuals). Results indicated modest overlap between personality and parenting. In addition, univariate behavioral genetic analyses indicated moderate genetic influence on select parenting dimensions. Results also indicated that the moderate phenotypic covariation between personality and parenting was attributed largely to nongenetic factors. Implications of the findings for research on parenting and personality are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {After briefly recapitulating two earlier German twin studies (BiLSAT and GOSAT), we present two new German twin studies with a longitudinal perspective: CoSMoS and TwinPaW. The twin study on Cognitive ability, Self-reported Motivation and School performance (CoSMoS) aims to investigate predictors and influences of school performance in a genetically sensitive design, beginning with children in late elementary school. The Twin study on Personality And Wellbeing (TwinPaW) focuses on adult personality and its relation to physical health as well as health-related behavior in an adult sample of twins. Both studies are characterized by an effort to recruit new large twin samples through a novel recruitment procedure aimed at reducing self-selective sampling. In two German federal states, contact information on persons born on the same day and with the same name was retrieved from record sections. From the resulting pool of more than 36,000 addresses we contacted approximately 2000 parents of twins aged 9 and 10 for CoSMoS, as well as 2000 adult twin pairs for TwinPaW by telephone and mail. Personal contact by telephone proved to be more efficient with agreement rates of 63% in the children sample and 65% in the adult sample. In this article we briefly describe the rationale and the study aims of CoSMoS and TwinPaW as well as the characteristics of the sample we have recruited so far.

Method 2 was found to be seriously biased, essentially because a nonlinear transform was applied to a linear hypothesis.

Patients who experienced sudden gains were less depressed than the other patients at posttreatment, and they remained so 18 months later.

Many CT patients experience sudden gains: large symptom improvement in 1 between-session interval. Past studies have associated CT sudden gains with in-session cognitive changes but not with life events. This study examined sudden gains and depression relapse/recurrence among 60 CT clinical-trial patients. Survival analyses showed that only one third of sudden-gain-responders relapsed in 2 years, and they had 74% lower relapse risks than did non-sudden-gain-responders. Among patients with sustained responses, 73% experienced sudden gains. The authors also replicated J. R. Vittengl, L. A. Clark, and R. B.

However, results with simulated data indicate that the demonstrable contribution to criterion variance made by these interactions may be modest. The present analyses, including a reanalysis of Bem and Allen's own data, highlight the importance of unmoderated, linear relationships.

Specifically, 2 kinds of physiological index were employed, 1 in which the S's physiological change score was represented by the single system showing the greatest change, and a 2nd index weighted equally by all 4 physiological measures.

One activation dimension ranges from subjectively defined feelings of energy and vigor to the opposite feelings of sleepiness and tiredness. Activation states associated with this dimension regularly vary in a circadian rhythm, and this dimension underlies gross physical activity and many aspects of cognition. The second dimension ranges from subjective tension to placidity and quietness, and it probably underlies a variety of emotions (e.g., anxiety) and stress reactions (e.g., effects of loud noise). While the two dimensions are positively correlated at moderate levels of energy expenditure, they are negatively correlated at high levels of expenditure; therefore, tension is lowest when energy-vigor is greatest and vice versa. Vulnerability to tension increases at late night, early morning, and at other times when effort and stress have increased tiredness and reduced vigorousness. Extremely low activation on either dimension de-energizes the whole system. Although only two dimensions are assumed, the possibility of four or more activation dimensions is discussed.

Measures of episodic and semantic memory were generally unrelated, and clustering in episodic learning was unrelated to performance on other tasks. This was also true for the verbal-discrimination task and for a task measuring susceptibility to interference. 22 measures of episodic memory were included in a factor analysis from which 5 factors emerged. One factor was tied to free-recall tasks, another to paired-associate and serial tasks. Memory span, including span for digits and for letters of high and low acoustic similarity, constituted a 3rd factor. The 4th involved verbal-discrimination lists, and frequency assimilation and classical recognition constituted a 5th. The failure of attributes to form factors seems to have been due to 2 contrary forces: (1) Among tasks in which associative learning is required, individual differences in associative learning are so strong that any variation produced by attributes has little influence. (2) There was some evidence that experienced Ss can set aside attributes when use of attributes as a basis for responding produces interference. The presence of attributes in memory and the use of attributes for responding are independent matters. (31 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

These scales satisfy a set of scaling conditions, one of which follows from the model of monotone homogeneity. An important drawback of the MSA program is that the sequential item selection and scale construction procedure may not find the dominant underlying dimensionality of the responses to a set of items. The authors investigated alternative hierarchical item selection procedures and compared the performance of four hierarchical methods and the sequential clustering method in the MSA context. The results showed that hierarchical clustering methods can improve the search process of the dominant dimensionality of a data matrix. In particular, the complete linkage and scale linkage methods were promising in finding the dimensionality of the item response data from a set of items.

Second, polychoric correlations and appropriate item-analytic models can circumvent problems that may be associated with unipolar scales; consequently, it is unnecessary (and undesirable) to use bipolar formats in affect assessment. Third, no evidence supports their claim that general mood ratings are less valid than other measures of long-term affect.

The authors' review of the literature indicates that this 2-factor model captures robust structural properties of self-rated mood. Nevertheless, the evidence also indicates that the circumplex does not fit the data closely and needs to be refined. Most notably, the model's dimensions are not entirely independent; moreover, with the exception of Pleasantness-Unpleasantness, they are not completely bipolar. More generally, the data suggest a model that falls somewhere between classic simple structure and a true circumplex. The authors then examine two of the dimensions imbedded in this structure, which they label Negative Activation (NA) and Positive Activation (PA). The authors argue that PA and NA represent the subjective components of broader biobehavioral systems of approach and withdrawal, respectively.

General procedures for developing structured taxonomies within domains are illustrated with reference to the interpersonal domain. Theoretical considerations dictated the definition of the universe of content, the choice of measurement model, and the procedures for classifying terms within the domain. Eight adjectival scales were developed as markers of the principal vectors of the interpersonal domain. The substantive, structural, and psychometric characteristics of these scales were found to be highly satisfactory. Hence, they may prove useful both as assessment devices in their own right and as reference points for the classification of variables in personality and social psychology.

However, many articles in statistical journals indicate that the usual estimate of rho , r, is sensitive to at least 6 features of data, and that least squares regression and rho are not robust in the sense reviewed in this article. In practical terms, r can be a highly unsatisfactory measure of the strength of an association, no matter how large the sample size might be. One specific problem is that it can miss strong associations that are detected by more modern techniques. The practical problems with r reflect fundamental concerns about a strict reliance on least squares regression. A few of the many modern methods for dealing with these concerns are briefly indicated.

When the assumptions underlying the derivation of this test are true, its power, meaning its probability of de-tecting true differences among the groups, competes well with all other methods that might be used. But when these assumptions are false, its power can be relatively low. Many new statistical methods have been proposed--ones that are aimed at achieving about the same amount of power when the assumptions of the F test are true but which have the potential of high power in situations where the F test performs poorly.

	Abstract = {Let (Y-sub(i), X-sub(i)), i=1, ..., n, be a random sample from some bivariate distribution, and let rho be the (Pearson) population correlation between X and Y. In the social sciences, the most common method for attempting to detect an association between Y and X is to test the hypothesis that Pearson's correlation is zero using Student's t test. The usual Student's t test of H-sub-0: rho=0 is valid when Y and X are independent, so in particular the conditional variance of Y , given X, does not vary with X. But when the conditional variance does vary with X, Student's t uses an incorrect estimate of the standard error. In effect, when rejecting H-sub-0, this might be due to rhonot-equal-to 0, but perhaps the main reason for rejecting it is that there is heteroscedasticity. This note compares two heteroscedastic methods for testing H-sub-0 and finds that in terms of Type I errors, the nested bootstrap performed best in simulations when using rho. When using one of two robust analogues of rho (Spearman's rho and the percentage bend correlation), little or no advantage was found, in terms of Type I error probabilities, when using a nested bootstrap versus the basic percentile method.

The present investigation sought to extend such individual differences to the cognitive level of analysis. It was hypothesized that individual differences in agreeableness would predict the extent to which either antisocial or prosocial words are selected for prolonged processing. Two studies, involving 90 undergraduates, asked participants to encode prosocial and antisocial stimuli, before measuring the speed with which they could spatially disengage attention from such stimuli. As predicted, individuals low in agreeableness exhibited difficulties disengaging from antisocial stimuli, whereas individuals high in agreeableness exhibited difficulties disengaging from prosocial stimuli. This novel finding isolates a particular set of attentional processes that likely contribute to agreeableness-related outcomes such as anger and aggression.

Similar successes resulted in large-scale evaluation projects in the German health and rehabilitation system (Wittmann, Niibling, & Schmidt, 2002), as well as research about the relationships among working memory, intelligence, knowledge, and complex problem-solving performance in complex computer-based business games (Wittmann & Suess, 1999) not reported here. The key concepts in all reported examples had been the application of symmetry principles in relating predictors, causes, and effects. Of special additional importance was incorporating psychometric principles into the experimental treatment to improve its measurement and to shed light into the black box. Investing more in the assessment of criteria and taking a larger slice out of human behavior over longer periods helped as well. We are reminded that time-series designs are the strongest quasi-experimental ones in terms of internal validity. Tools coined as ambulatory assessment have been developed to better assess behavior, feelings, emotions, and performance in real-life field settings. Fahrenberg and Myrtek (1996, 2001) contributed to their development and described the potential and promises. We are confident that assessment, measurement, theory testing, and construct validation will reach new horizons by integrating these tools into our research designs.

Both groups assume that if a category can't be conceptualized as a natural kind, it is an arbitrary category. I argue that conceptualizing psychiatric disorders as bounded entities in nature is inconsistent both with medicine's understanding of disease and evolutionary biology's understanding of species. In contrast to natural kinds, I introduce the concept of practical kinds, which are stable patterns that can be identified with varying levels of reliability and validity.

A standard go-no-go discrimination learning task was used in each of the 4 experiments. The results indicate that individual differences in performance of this discrimination are more consistently and strongly associated with impulsivity and anxiety than with extraversion and neuroticism. In each of the experiments, high anxiety hindered the learning of a go-no-go discrimination more among high-impulsive Ss than among low impulsive Ss, and in 2 of the experiments high anxiety actually facilitated learning among low impulsive Ss. These findings are incompatible with H. J. Eysenck's (1967) and J. A. Gray's (1982) hypotheses regarding extraversion but are not inconsistent with the hypotheses of J. P. Newman et al (see PA, Vol 72:22847). Aspects of these results do support J. T. Spence and K. W. Spence's (1966) and Gray's models of anxiety and instrumental conditioning. However, both of these models were contradicted by other trends in the data. A modification of Gray's model of impulsivity and anxiety that emphasizes the role of expectancies was proposed to fit these data.

Specifically, whereas there are conditions under which alpha, beta, and omega(h) are equivalent to each other and to one of the two conceptualizations of reliability considered here, we show that equality with this conceptualization of reliability and between alpha and omega(h) holds only under a highly restrictive set of conditions and that the conditions under which beta equals omega(h) are only somewhat more general.

	Abstract = {The extent to which a scale score generalizes to a latent variable common to all of the scale's indicators is indexed by the scale's general factor saturation. Seven techniques for estimating this parameter-omega(hierarchical) (omega(h))-are compared in a series of simulated data sets. Primary comparisons were based on 160 artificial data sets simulating perfectly simple and symmetric structures that contained four group factors, and an additional 200 artificial data sets confirmed large standard deviations for two methods in these simulations when a general factor was absent. Major findings were replicated in a series of 40 additional artificial data sets based on the structure of a real scale widely believed to contain three group factors of unequal size and less than perfectly simple structure. The results suggest that alpha and methods based on either the first unrotated principal factor or component should be rejected as estimates of w(h).},
