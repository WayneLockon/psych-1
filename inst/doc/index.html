<h2>psych: A package for personality, psychometric, and psychological research</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The psych package has been developed at Northwestern University to include functions most useful for personality and psychological research.  Some of the functions (e.g., describe and  pairs.panels are useful for basic descriptive analyses.
</p>
<p>
Psychometric applications include routines for Very Simple Structure, Item Cluster Analysis, ICLUST, as well as functions to do Schmid Leiman transformations, principal axes factor analysis, and to calculate reliability coefficients alpha, beta, and omega.
</p>


The extended <a href="psych-manual.pdf">user manual </a> includes examples of graphic output and more extensive demonstrations. 

<p> For a step by step tutorial in the use of the psych package and the base functions in R for basic personality research, see the <a href="http://personalitytheory.org/r/r.short.html">guide for personality research</a>. 

<P>
Note: the most recent development version is available as a source file at the repository maintained at <a href="http://personality-project.org/r"> http:personality-project.org/r </a> .  That version will have removed the most recently discovered bugs (but perhaps introduced other, yet to be discovered ones).
